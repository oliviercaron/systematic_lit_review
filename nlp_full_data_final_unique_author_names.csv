1;57207911180;Loupos P.;Loupos;UC Davis Graduate School of Management;Davis;United States;What reviews foretell about opening weekend box office revenue: the harbinger of failure effect in the movie industry;Marketing Letters;We empirically investigate the harbinger of failure phenomenon in the motion picture industry by analyzing the pre-release reviews written on movies by film critics. We find that harbingers of failure do exist. Their positive (negative) pre-release movie reviews provide a strong predictive signal that the movie will turn out to be a flop (success). This signal persists even for the top critic category, which usually consists of professional critics, indicating that having expertise in a professional domain does not necessarily lead to correct predictions. Our findings challenge the current belief that positive reviews always help enhance box office revenue and shed new light on the influencer-predictor hypothesis. We further analyze the writing style of harbingers and provide new insights into their personality traits and cognitive biases.;0;4;Harbingers of failure | Movies | Preference heterogeneity | Reviews | Text analytics;2023;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;40;Marketing Letters

2;57076843000;Krefeld-Schwalb A.;Krefeld-Schwalb;Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam;Rotterdam;Netherlands;Tighter nets for smaller fishes? Mapping the development of statistical practices in consumer research between 2008 and 2020;Marketing Letters;During the last decade, confidence in many social sciences, including consumer research, has been undermined by doubts about the replicability of empirical research findings. These doubts have led to increased calls to improve research practices and adopt new measures to increase the replicability of published work from various stakeholders such as funding agencies, journals, and scholars themselves. Despite these demands, it is unclear to which the research published in the leading consumer research journals has adhered to these calls for change. This article provides the first systematic empirical analysis of this question by surveying three crucial statistics of published consumer research over time: sample sizes, effect sizes, and the distribution of published p values. The authors compile a hand-coded sample of N = 258 articles published between 2008 and 2020 in the Journal of Consumer Psychology, the Journal of Consumer Research, and the Journal of Marketing Research. An automated text analysis across all publications in these three journals corroborates the representativeness of the hand-coded sample. Results reveal a substantial increase in sample sizes above and beyond the use of online samples along with a decrease in reported effect sizes. Effect and samples sizes are highly correlated which at least partially explains the reduction in reported effect sizes.;3;2;Experimental research methods | False-positive results | Review;2023;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;53;Marketing Letters

3;58085900500;Kronrod A.;Kronrod;University of Massachusetts Lowell;Lowell;United States;Been There, Done That: How Episodic and Semantic Memory Affects the Language of Authentic and Fictitious Reviews;Journal of Consumer Research;This article suggests a theory-driven approach to address the managerial problem of distinguishing between real and fake reviews. Building on memory research and linguistics, we predict that when recollecting an authentic experience in a product review, people rely to a greater extent on episodic memory. By contrast, when writing a fictitious review, people do not have episodic memory available to them. Therefore, they must rely to a greater extent on semantic memory. We suggest that reliance on these different memory types is reflected in the language used in authentic and fictitious reviews. We develop predictions about five linguistic features characterizing authentic versus fictitious reviews. We test our predictions via a multi-method approach, combining computational linguistics, experimental design, and machine learning. We employ a large-scale experiment to derive a dataset of reviews, as well as two datasets containing reviews from online platforms. We also test whether an algorithm relying on our theory-driven linguistic features is context independent, relative to other benchmark algorithms, and shows better cross-domain performance when tested across datasets. By developing a theory that extends memory and psycholinguistics research to the realm of word of mouth, this work contributes to our understanding of how authentic and fictitious reviews are created.;0;3;fake reviews | lie detection | linguistic features | machine learning | memory | text analysis;2023;Business and International Management | Anthropology | Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous) | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;139;Journal of Consumer Research

Online reviews and ratings have played a vital role to assess the performance of the services or the quality of goods. This research explores customers' levels of satisfaction with baby products on Amazon.com through text mining and survey-based methodologies. The moderating role of a brand image is also investigated on the relationship between customers' satisfaction and recommendations to others. Two sources of data were utilized, online reviews from the Amazon portal and responses of the participants on a large-scale survey. The research model is developed based on the factors that were extracted from the text mining approach. Following that, a questionnaire was distributed and the collected data were inspected using Partial Least Squares Structural Equations Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings revealed that several dimensions have an influential effect on customers' experiences with baby products, among which are comfortableness, material quality, easy use, easy return, design, price, packaging, and size information. In addition, the moderating influence of the brand image on the hypothesis between customers' satisfaction and recommendations to others was significant. By deploying the two-phase methodology, baby product vendors can understand the influential variables in customers' experiences and their impacts on customers’ satisfaction more accurately.;0;6;Analytic approach | Baby product | Brand image | Machine learning | Satisfaction;2023;Marketing;172;Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services

8;57189343074;Sun B.;Sun;Harbin Engineering University;Harbin;China;How online reviews with different influencing factors affect the diffusion of new products;International Journal of Consumer Studies;Online reviews are becoming increasingly important for the diffusion of new products. Based on the content of online reviews on JD.com, the study utilizes the Latent Allocation model to identify the critical factors of interest to consumers and categorized them into two categories, namely, product quality and supporting service factors.

We further investigate how the interaction between the critical metrics of online reviews affects the diffusion of new products. The results indicate that as various factors are considered, online reviews have a significantly different impact on the diffusion of new products.

In many cases, there is very little information about these names. For example, treatment lotion by “Lady Aiko.” This research examines whether such a strategy effectively increases evaluations for a product. If so, is this strategy more effective when used by a high-quality brand or a low-quality brand? Across one field study, one text analytics study, and two experimental studies, we find that the proper name strategy can lead to higher product evaluations and that such names are more effective when advertised for a low-quality brand. We first propose, using contagion effects, that products advertised with a proper name are more likely to contain the essence of human creation, resulting in greater product effectiveness than identical products without such proper names. Furthermore, we employ the expectation-disconfirmation account to propose that when the brand has a higher (vs. lower) quality (expectation stage), the product with a proper name strategy (postexpectation stage) leads to small (vs. large) positive disconfirmation, which thereby results in assimilation (vs. contrast) and forming product evaluations similar (vs. higher) to the original assessments of the brand. We offer implications for new product marketers on how to be most effective in influencing product evaluations, as well as policymakers looking to improve consumer welfare by encouraging manufacturers of generic products to consider using a proper name strategy.;0;3;branding | contagion | expectation-disconfirmation | product judgments | proper names | quality;2023;Applied Psychology | Marketing;97;Psychology and Marketing

The current work demonstrates across four studies that voice-based (as opposed to text-based) interfaces promote more flow-like user experiences, resulting in more positively-valenced service experiences, and ultimately more favorable behavioral firm outcomes (i.e., contract renewal, conversion rates, and consumer sentiment). Moreover, we also provide evidence for two important boundary conditions that reduce such flow-like user experiences in voice-based interfaces (i.e., semantic disfluency and the amount of conversational turns). The findings of this research highlight how fundamental theories of human communication can be harnessed to create more experiential service experiences with positive downstream consequences for consumers and firms.

12;56009809300;Jalali N.;Jalali;The University of North Carolina at Charlotte;Charlotte;United States;Profiling diverse reviewer segments using online reviews of service industries;Journal of Marketing Analytics;Consumers often rely on online review sites (e.g., Yelp, TripAdvisor) to read reviews on service products they may consider choosing. Despite the usefulness of such reviews, consumers may have difficulty finding reviews suitable for their own preferences because those reviews possess significant preference heterogeneity among reviewers. Differences in the four dimensions of individual reviewers (Experience, Productivity, Details, and Criticalness) lead them to have differential impacts on various consumers. Thus, this research is aimed at understanding the profiles of multiple influential reviewer segments in the service industries under two fundamental evaluation principles (Quality and Likeness). Based on the results, we theorize that reviewer influence arises from writing either reviews of high quality (Quality) or reviews reflecting a significant segment of consumers’ common preferences (Likeness). Using two service product categories (restaurants and hotels), we empirically identify and profile four specific influential review segments: (1) top-tier quality reviewers, (2) second-tier quality reviewers, (3) likeness (common) reviewers, and (4) less critical likeness reviewers. By using our approach, product review website managers can present product reviews in such a way that users can easily choose reviews and reviewers that match their preferences out of a vast collection of reviews containing all kinds of preferences.;0;3;Finite mixture modeling | Online reviewer | Reviewer segmentation | Text mining;2023;Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous) | Strategy and Management | Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty | Marketing;112;Journal of Marketing Analytics

EWOM allows researchers to get new insights about consumers’ behavior and explores new patterns of consumers’ decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991), doubled with “cognitive–affective–conative” model (Oliver, 2014). This study applies structural topic modeling to examine the impact of satisfaction dimensions from all the Tripadvisor reviews on consumer behavioral intentions. The research sample covers all restaurants located in St. Petersburg (n = 10,424) and all consumers’ reviews (n = 286,642). Findings: In this study, the dimensions of the affective component were identified. The results demonstrate that dimensions of the affective component (food quality, service quality, atmosphere and cost fairness) affect behavioral intention (willingness to share positive emotions). In total, 20 topics, forming these dimensions, have been indicated. Consumers tend to pay more attention toward food quality and restaurant staffs’ work when they are willing to share positive emotions and tend to point out auxiliary service when they have less willingness to share positive emotions. Random restaurant visits tend to increase the willingness to share positive emotions. Originality/value: Research originality lies in a new methodological approach which is based on text mining techniques. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first attempt to examine consumer behavior through the lens of the “cognitive–affective–conative” model based on eWOM and covers all businesses in the specific economic sphere.

An Indian food delivery portal (Zomato.com) was used, where 50 restaurants on Presence Across Nation (PAN) basis were selected through stratified random sampling. A total of 2530 reviews were collected, scrutinized, and analysed. Using the NVivo software for qualitative analysis, seven themes were identified from collected reviews, out of which, the ‘delivery’ theme was explored further for identifying sub-themes. Linear regression modelling was used to identify the variables affecting delivery ratings and sentiment analysis was also performed on the identified sub-themes. Regression results revealed that hygiene and pricing (delivery subthemes) demonstrated lower delivery ratings. These variables can be established as indicators for restaurants and related online food delivery services to build their business model around them. Similarly, negative sentiments were observed in pricing and hygiene sub-themes. Restaurants and online food services can enhance hygiene levels of their food delivery process in order to receive higher delivery ratings. Similarly, pricing of food items can be modified such that customers are not deterred from ordering the items—food and ordering service do not become cost-prohibitive. This study devised a standardized methodology for analysing vast amounts of online user-generated content (UGC). Findings from this study can be extrapolated to other sectors and service industries such as, tourism, cleaning, transportation, hospitals and engineering especially during the pandemic.;1;5;customer satisfaction | food delivery | NVivo | qualitative data analysis | ratings | reviews;2023;Applied Psychology | Economics and Econometrics | Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health | Marketing;136;International Journal of Consumer Studies

While automation provides convenience and efficiency benefits consumers value, related evidence suggests it can also undermine post-purchase consumer product responses of importance to managers (e.g., brand loyalty). Using insights derived from Amazon customer reviews, a survey of product owners, a virtual reality lab, and two vignette experiments, we formally explore this possibility and find that automation is indeed a double-edged sword. That is, we uncover that automation has undesirable effects on post-purchase outcomes because it interferes with psychological ownership formation. We also find that, depending on consumer identity motives (e.g., task-related vs. technology-related) and product design affordances (e.g., a remote access feature), this effect can be strengthened, weakened, or even reversed.

However, surprisingly little effort has been made to understand m-banking service quality using these reviews. Therefore, this study aims to discover m-banking service quality dimensions from customers' reviews of the m-banking apps through a text mining approach. Design/methodology/approach: Reviews of m-banking apps of 24 banks operating in Pakistan were scraped from Google Play Store. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method was applied to discover the dimensions of m-banking service quality from 24,529 positive and 29,569 negative useable reviews. Findings: Different dimensions of m-banking service quality are discussed in positive and negative reviews. Positive reviews focus on security, convenience, ease of use, continuous improvement, usefulness and app attributes, whereas negative reviews discuss system availability, responsiveness, faulty updates, login problems and reliability. Research limitations/implications: The results are based only on customer reviews in one country and generalization may not be possible. Moreover, due to the unavailability of demographic information about reviewers, the effect of demographic characteristics on users' perceptions of m-banking quality could not be determined. Practical implications: The study provides managers with useful insights to improve the service experience of m-banking customers. The study also demonstrates how managers can employ text analytical techniques to assess and improve the quality of m-banking services. Originality/value: In addition to enriching the understanding of m-banking quality based on direct and first-hand user experiences, the current study also provides initial evidence for the two-factor structure of m-banking service quality.;0;3;Mobile applications | Mobile banking (m-banking) | Service quality | Text mining | Topic modeling;2023;Marketing;66;International Journal of Bank Marketing

A consumer survey and text mining methods were used to create the consumer dictionary, and an extensive review of mindfulness definitions was used for the academic dictionary. The consumer dictionary described mindfulness more in terms of affect and resulting outcomes, while the academic dictionary was more cognitive and process-oriented. The dictionaries were then applied to marketers' communications from a database of 883 company descriptions that were classified as mindful. The results showed that marketers used more terms from the consumer dictionary than the academic dictionary. The article discusses the potential for consumers to be vulnerable to marketers' communication strategies, characterized as McMindfulness and mindful washing, that can impact consumers' well-being and brand relationships.;1;1;marketing communication | McMindfulness | mindful washing | mindfulness | text mining | well-being;2023;Sociology and Political Science | Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all);103;Journal of Consumer Affairs

This study aims to compare the latent themes uncovered by the topic modeling approach with studies focused on both mobile banking (m-banking) adaptation and service quality features, suggest new aspects and examine the effect of latent topics on customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed 21,526 reviews posted by customers of private and state banks operating in Türkiye. An unsupervised machine learning method, Latent Dirichlet algorithm (LDA), was conducted to reveal topics, and the distribution of all reviews was visualized with the t-SNE algorithm. Random Forest, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms were utilized to predict user satisfaction through the given score. Findings: In total, 11 topics were revealed by considering user reviews based on their experience. Among these topics, perceived usefulness and convenience and time-saving are much more important in the scoring given to m-banking apps. Furthermore, in more detail, seven topics have been identified related to technical and security problems related to m-banking apps. Originality/value: This paper is a pioneer study regarding the method used and sample size reached in the m-banking literature. The findings also provide fresh insight into the post-Covid-19 era, both academically and practically, by providing new features for mobile bank adoption.;3;1;Latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm | Machine learning | Mobile banking | Service quality | Technology adoption | Text mining;2023;Marketing;73;International Journal of Bank Marketing

The study of UX helps to integrate customers' potential needs into the product's design. Because customer reviews in e-commerce are not structured and categorized, it is necessary to analyze UX based on customer opinions systematically. This study tries to structure UX in a product's positive/negative context through a neural network-based self-organizing map (SOM). As a result of analyzing 10,482 reviews on wireless earbuds in BestBuy, an electronic product e-commerce platform, it was confirmed that it is a suitable method for categorizing user experiences between reviews and deriving important factors. In particular, the difference in core UX elements by positive/negative context of the product was verified based on the star rating.

23;55123240900;Herhausen D.;Herhausen;NA;NA;NA;Complaint De-Escalation Strategies on Social Media;Journal of Marketing;To date, the literature offers multiple suggestions for how to recover from service failures, albeit without explicitly addressing customers’ negative, high-arousal states evoked by the failure. The few studies that do address ways to improve negative emotions after failures focus on face-to-face interactions only. Because many customers today prefer to complain on social media, firms must learn how to effectively de-escalate negative, high-arousal emotions through text-based exchanges to achieve successful service recoveries. With three field studies using natural language processing tools and three preregistered controlled experiments, the current research identifies ways to mitigate negative arousal in text-based social media complaining, specifically, active listening and empathy. In detail, increasing active listening and empathy in the firm response evokes gratitude among customers in high-arousal states, even if the actual failure is not (yet) recovered. These findings provide a new theoretical perspective on the role of customer arousal in service failures and recoveries as well as managerially relevant implications for dealing with public social media complaints.;4;6;de-escalation | digital service recovery | negative arousal | social media complaints;2023;Business and International Management | Marketing;70;Journal of Marketing

24;57279681800;Park J.;Park;Yonsei University;Seoul;South Korea;Text mining-based four-step framework for smart speaker product improvement and sales planning;Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services;The smart speaker market, which is considered an early-stage market, is expected to grow rapidly as smart speakers become a part of daily life. Consequently, manufacturers are trying to dominate the market. To achieve this, they must analyze users' reactions to their products and find insights for product improvement through comparison with competitors. We propose a four-step methodological framework for identifying meaningful opinions from a large number of online user reviews. First, network analysis is conducted to compare differences between brands. Next, through topic modeling, the attributes of speakers that users consider the most crucial are extracted for each brand. Third, sentiment analysis is conducted to examine how users' emotional polarities differ for each attribute. Through this, product improvement and product sales plans can be derived. Finally, in order to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each brand, brand positioning is conducted and user opinions that have changed along with the evolution of the speaker's generation are analyzed. Our study identified the factors that positively or negatively affect the experience of smart speaker users. In addition, the proposed method is highly useful because it can be used to derive insights from a large amount of user opinion data regardless of the search term.;4;3;Brand positioning | Decision support | Online review | Sales planning | Smart speaker | Text analysis;2023;Marketing;91;Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services

Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called SiEBERT) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon.;19;4;Deep Contextual Language Models | Machine Learning | Meta-Analysis | Natural Language Processing | Sentiment Analysis | Text Mining | Transfer Learning;2023;Marketing;48;International Journal of Research in Marketing

In this paper we show how new achievements in natural language processing can provide an important assist for different kinds of review-related writing tasks. Working in the interesting context of wine reviews, we demonstrate that machines are capable of performing the critical marketing task of writing expert reviews directly from a fairly small amount of product attribute data (metadata). We conduct a kind of “Turing Test” to evaluate human response to our machine-written reviews and show strong support for the assertion that machines can write reviews that are indistinguishable from those written by experts. Rather than replacing the human review writer, we envision a workflow wherein machines take the metadata as inputs and generate a human readable review as a first draft of the review and thereby assist an expert reviewer in writing their review. We next modify and apply our machine-writing technology to show how machines can be used to write a synthesis of a set of product reviews. For this last application we work in the context of beer reviews (for which there is a large set of available reviews for each of a large number of products) and produce machine-written review syntheses that do a good job – measured again through human evaluation – of capturing the ideas expressed in the reviews of any given beer.

In particular, the paper investigates the alignment between the art museum’s brand identity and the brand image emerging from visitors’ narratives of their experience. The study adopts a mixed methodology based on netnography and text mining techniques. The analysis concerns an art museum’s brand, with the case of the “Opera del Duomo Museum” in Florence. The methodological approach enables a combined investigation of user-generated content in online communities and the company’s online brand communication, contributing to identifying branding actions that can be taken to increase the brand alignment. It also enables the measurement of the degree of alignment between museums and visitors among common brand themes. Specific indicators of alignment are provided. A key point is the replicability of the model in other contexts of analysis in which the content produced by consumers in online contexts are relevant and readily available, such as fashion or food.;0;3;Art museum | Brand identity | Brand image | Digital ethnography | Text mining | User-generated content;2023;Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;69;International Review on Public and Nonprofit Marketing

It also enables the measurement of the degree of alignment between museums and visitors among common brand themes. Specific indicators of alignment are provided. A key point is the replicability of the model in other contexts of analysis in which the content produced by consumers in online contexts are relevant and readily available, such as fashion or food.;0;3;Art museum | Brand identity | Brand image | Digital ethnography | Text mining | User-generated content;2023;Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;69;International Review on Public and Nonprofit Marketing

This study further presents a method for deriving inter-brand similarities from data on how the sales of competing brands covary over time. The results obtained by the above two methods are compared to each other. Design/methodology/approach: In drawing similarities between brands, the authors utilized a newly proposed measure that modified the lift measure. The derived similarity information was applied to multidimensional scaling (MDS) to analyze the perceived market structure. The authors applied the proposed methodology to the imported car market in South Korea. Findings: In light of some clear information such as the country of origin, the market structure derived from the presented methodology was seen to accurately reflect the consumer's perception of the market. A significant relevance has been found between the results derived from user-generated online content and sales data. Originality/value: The presented method allows marketers to track changes in competitive market structures and identify their major competitors quickly and cost-effectively. This study can contribute to improving the utilization of the overflowing information in the big data era by proposing methods of linking new types of online data with existing market research methods.;1;3;Brand positioning | Inter-brand similarity | Lift measure | Perceptual mapping | Text mining;2023;Business and International Management | Strategy and Management | Marketing;48;Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics

30;56692096700;Cooper D.A.;Cooper;California State University Channel Islands;Camarillo;United States;Privacy considerations for online advertising: a stakeholder’s perspective to programmatic advertising;Journal of Consumer Marketing;Purpose: Privacy considerations have become a topic with increasing interest from academics, industry leaders and regulators. In response to consumers’ privacy concerns, Google announced in 2020 that Chrome would stop supporting third-party cookies in the near future. At the same time, advertising technology companies are developing alternative solutions for online targeting and consumer privacy controls. This paper aims to explore privacy considerations related to online tracking and targeting methods used for programmatic advertising (i.e. third-party cookies, Privacy Sandbox, Unified ID 2.0) for a variety of stakeholders: consumers, AdTech platforms, advertisers and publishers. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes the topic of internet user privacy concerns, through a multi-pronged approach: industry conversations to collect information, a comprehensive review of trade publications and extensive empirical analysis. This study uses two methods to collect data on consumer preferences for privacy controls: a survey of a representative sample of US consumers and field data from conversations on web-forums created by tech professionals. Findings: The results suggest that there are four main segments in the US internet user population. The first segment, consisting of 26% of internet users, is driven by a strong preference for relevant ads and includes consumers who accept the premises of both Privacy Sandbox and Unified ID (UID) 2.0. The second segment (26%) includes consumers who are ambivalent about both sets of premises. The third segment (34%) is driven by a need for relevant ads and a strong desire to prevent advertisers from aggressively collecting data, with consumers who accept the premises of Privacy Sandbox but reject the premises of UID 2.0. The fourth segment (15% of consumers) rejected both sets of premises about privacy control. Text analysis results suggest that the conversation around UID 2.0 is still nascent. Google Sandbox associations seem nominally positive, with sarcasm being an important factor in the sentiment analysis results. Originality/value: The value of this paper lies in its multi-method examination of online privacy concerns in light of the recent regulatory legislation (i.e. General Data Protection Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act) and changes for third-party cookies in browsers such as Firefox, Safari and Chrome. Two alternatives proposed to replace third-party cookies (Privacy Sandbox and Unified ID 2.0) are in the proposal and prototype stage. The elimination of third-party cookies will affect stakeholders, including different types of players in the AdTech industry and internet users.

31;58043994300;Lee N.;Lee;NA;NA;NA;Vertical Versus Horizontal Variance in Online Reviews and Their Impact on Demand;Journal of Marketing Research;This article examines the differential impact of variances in the quality and taste comments found in online customer reviews on firm sales. Using an analytic model, the authors show that although increased variance in consumer reviews about taste mismatch normally decreases subsequent demand, it can increase demand when mean ratings are low and/or quality variance is high. In contrast, increased variance in quality always decreases subsequent demand, although this effect is moderated by the amount of variance in tastes. Since these theoretical demand effects are predicated on the assumption that consumers can differentiate between the two sources of variation in ratings, the authors conduct a survey to test this assumption, demonstrating that participants are indeed able to reliably distinguish quality from taste evaluations in two subsets of 5,000 reviews taken from larger data sets of reviews for 4,305 restaurants and 3,460 hotels. The authors use these responses to construct sets of reviews that they use in a controlled laboratory experiment on restaurant choice, finding strong support for the theoretical predictions. These responses are also used to train classifiers using a bag-of-words model to predict the degree to which each review in the larger data sets relates to quality and/or taste, allowing the authors to estimate the two types of review variances. Finally, the authors estimate the effects of these variances in overall ratings on establishment sales, again finding support for the theoretical results.;1;3;crowdsourced data | machine learning | quality and taste variance | review variance | text analysis | vertical and horizontal content;2023;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;34;Journal of Marketing Research

The goal of this study is to better understand the importance of consistently following an entrepreneurial orientation, as well as the linkage of such a consistently implemented strategy upon gaining both a cost and differentiation positioning enhancement. Design/methodology/approach: Two empirical studies are conducted to test the proposed hypotheses – one longitudinal with multiple forms of data (i.e. text data, survey data and archival data) from 100 Taiwanese electronics firms and the other using primary data from a survey of senior managers. Findings: Entrepreneurial orientation improves dynamic capabilities, which in turn promote superior DCAA and enhanced firm performance. In addition, as captured through a unique measure of consistency allowed through computer-aided text analysis, the results indicate that the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on dynamic capabilities is amplified when a firm consistently adopts entrepreneurial decisions and actions. Research limitations/implications: The specific context was a sample of electronics firms in Taiwan. This limits the generalization of findings, as would be possible with assessing the hypotheses in other industries. Practical implications: This research clearly demonstrates the significance of consistency in pursuing a strategic orientation. The consistent support and deployment of resources facilitates an organization’s achieving positive outcomes associated with an entrepreneurial orientation. Originality/value: While entrepreneurial orientation contributes to firm performance, extant knowledge on the internal process through which entrepreneurial orientation affects performance is relatively limited. The findings not only highlight the full mediating role of dynamic capabilities and DCAA, but also shed light on the importance of consistency in entrepreneurial orientation over time.;0;4;Ambidextrous competitive advantage | Computer-aided text analysis | Dynamic capabilities | Entrepreneurial orientation | Longitudinal design;2023;Marketing;131;European Journal of Marketing

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether venture capitalists reward extensive marketing strategies in their startup valuation and whether the marketing mix planning and early strategies on customer orientation predict long-term development of startups. Design/methodology/approach: To address these gaps, this study investigate 107 business plans of new ventures which received venture capital based on these planning documents. The authors use computer-aided text analysis and regression analyses. Findings: This study’s findings show that customer orientation has positive effects on new venture performance and intensive marketing mix planning increases the likelihood of survival. However, venture capitalists decrease their startup valuation when they read too much about customer orientation and operative marketing mix planning. Originality/value: This study relies on unique internal documents and therefore provides valuable and new insights for research and practice.

We draw on mind perception theory to assess whether the attribution of mental states to smart objects reveals differences in consumer–smart object relationships and device usage. We train a language model to unobtrusively predict mind perception in smart objects from consumer-generated text. We provide a rich set of interpretable linguistic markers for mind perception, drawing on a diverse collection of text-mining techniques, and demonstrate that greater mind perception is associated with expressing a more communal (vs. instrumental) relationship with the device and using it more expansively. We find converging evidence for these associations using over 20,000 real-world customer reviews and also provide causal evidence that inducing a more communal (vs. instrumental) relationship with a smart object enhances mind perception and in turn increases the number of tasks consumers engage in with the device. These findings have important implications for the role of mind perception as a novel lens to study consumer–smart object relationships. We offer an easy-to-use web interface to access our language model using researchers own data or to fine-tune the model to entirely new domains.;0;3;deep learning | interpretable machine learning | language models | mind perception | natural language processing | smart objects | text mining | theory of mind;2023;Applied Psychology | Marketing;97;Journal of Consumer Psychology

Broadly speaking, reviews rated by consumers as more helpful exert a greater influence downstream. The current research examines how the linguistic characteristics of a review affect its helpfulness score. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), this research analyzes the linguistic subjectivity and objectivity of over 2 million reviews on Amazon. The results show that, ceteris paribus, both linguistic subjectivity and objectivity have a positive impact on review helpfulness. However, contrary to consumers' intuition, when subjectivity and objectivity are combined in the same review, review helpfulness increases less than their respective separate effects would predict, especially for hedonic products. We conceptualize that this results from the increased complexity of messages mixing subjective and objective sentences, which requires more effortful processing.

However, many are hesitant to do so lest they make missteps, promises they cannot keep, appear inauthentic, or alienate consumers, employees, or other stakeholders. Here we investigate consumers' impressions of firms that respond quickly or slowly to sociopolitical events. Using data scraped from Instagram and three online experiments (N = 2452), we find that consumers express more positive sentiment and greater purchasing intentions toward firms that react more quickly to sociopolitical issues. Unlike other types of public firm decision making such as product launch, where careful deliberation can be appreciated, consumers treat firm response time to sociopolitical events as an informative cue of the firm's authentic commitment to the issue. We identify an important boundary condition of this main effect: speedy responses bring limited benefits when the issue is highly divisive along political lines.

Most evaluations of passive voice are experimental or small-scale field studies, however, and perhaps one reason for its lack of adoption is the difficulty associated with obtaining valid, reliable, and replicable results through automated means.

This package achieves 98% agreement with human-coded data for grammatical voice as revealed in two large validation studies. In this paper, we discuss how PassivePy works, and present preliminary empirical evidence of how passive voice connects to various behavioral outcomes across three contexts relevant to consumer psychology: product complaints, online reviews, and charitable giving.

Regulatory mode complementarity refers to the combination of high assessment (i.e., the motivation to “be right” by critically evaluating options) and high locomotion (i.e., the motivation to “act” by moving toward a goal). Specifically, this research proposes that an abstract (vs. concrete) construal allows these two orientations to work together, resulting in regulatory fit.

How expected and actual nutritional value affect the content and linguistic characteristics of online reviews for food products;Journal of Consumer Psychology;Consumers are choosing to purchase food products from retailers through online channels rather than brick-and-mortar channels. While online reviews play a crucial role in influencing online purchases, scant work has examined how consumers write reviews for food products. We argue that the nutritional value of the food is a key aspect of product performance and apply expectation-disconfirmation theory to examine whether pre-purchase expectations about a food product's nutritional value and disconfirmation of these expectations have a significant effect on online review content and linguistic characteristics. Using text-mining approaches to analyze Amazon data, we find that pre-purchase expectations, postpurchase performance, and disconfirmation regarding nutritional value affect both review content and linguistic characteristics, including review length, diversity, readability, subjectivity, and sentiment. While research suggests that postpurchase product performance is the main influence on online review writing behavior, this research shows that the pre-purchase phase also plays a key role.;0;4;linguistics | nutrition | online consumer reviews | online food retail | text mining;2023;Applied Psychology | Marketing;103;Journal of Consumer Psychology

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses data extracted from 2,081 videos posted on the prominent Chinese online live platform, Bilibili. The hypotheses are tested using regression models and natural language processing. Findings: The results indicate that the intensity of live comments at the beginning negatively affects users' digital engagement, while a corresponding increase in live comments at the end elicits a positive effect. A linear trend and peak difference in live comments intensity positively affect digital engagement, while the variability of live comment intensity exerts a negative effect. These MTM effects were driven by sentiments of live comments. Furthermore, in-video advertisements are likely to amplify the negative beginning effect on users' digital engagement and mitigate the negative variability of live comments. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine the direct effects of MTM comments from the online temporal sequence perspective, differentiating the process- and performance-based engagement.

If so, do consumers find reviews more helpful when photos and text convey similar or different information? This article examines the effect of content similarity between photos and text on review helpfulness and its underlying mechanism. Using a data set of 7.4 million reviews associated with 3.5 million photos from Yelp, and applying machine learning algorithms, the authors quantify the similarity of the content between text and photos. They find that, overall, photos increase the helpfulness of a review. More importantly, though, greater similarity between photos and text heightens review helpfulness more. The authors then validate algorithm-based similarity assessments with similarity perceptions of human judges. Using real-world reviews from Yelp and carefully designed stimuli, they replicate the core findings in five laboratory experiments. Further, testing the underlying mechanism, they find that greater similarity facilitates the ease with which consumers can process the review, which, in turn, increases that review's helpfulness to consumers. Finally, they show that factors that impede the ease of processing (e.g., language difficulty or poor image quality) can reduce the effect of similarity on helpfulness. These findings provide novel insights into the value of user-generated content that includes text and photos and its underlying mechanism.;0;3;helpfulness | natural language processing | photos | reviews | similarity | user-generated content | visuals;2023;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;75;Journal of Marketing Research

49;57224812219;Tandilashvili N.;Tandilashvili;ISC Paris Business School;Paris;France;The role of affective ties in the asymmetrical relationship between student satisfaction and loyalty. Comparative study of European business schools;Journal of Marketing for Higher Education;In the context of an increasingly competitive environment in higher education, this article looks at the determinants of student satisfaction in European business schools. We analysed one French and one Georgian business school through a survey of 551 students. Structural equation modelling was used to test the research hypotheses, with qualitative data analysis further explaining the findings. The results identify the determinants of student satisfaction and confirm a positive and significant influence of student satisfaction on their loyalty. However, the findings reveal an asymmetrical relationship between the two constructs and suggest that, in addition to a high level of satisfaction, affective ties need to be ensured between HEIs and their students to generate loyalty.

Comparative study of European business schools;Journal of Marketing for Higher Education;In the context of an increasingly competitive environment in higher education, this article looks at the determinants of student satisfaction in European business schools. We analysed one French and one Georgian business school through a survey of 551 students. Structural equation modelling was used to test the research hypotheses, with qualitative data analysis further explaining the findings. The results identify the determinants of student satisfaction and confirm a positive and significant influence of student satisfaction on their loyalty. However, the findings reveal an asymmetrical relationship between the two constructs and suggest that, in addition to a high level of satisfaction, affective ties need to be ensured between HEIs and their students to generate loyalty.

50;35076857700;Yu B.;Yu;Macao Polytechnic University;Macau;Macao;Deep Learning Applications for Interactive Marketing in the Contemporary Digital Age;The Palgrave Handbook of Interactive Marketing;This chapter reviews recent research deploying deep learning (DL) to resolve problems in interactive marketing. It takes stock of what marketers know, how and why they do that. From an engagement marketing perspective, this chapter catalogues DL application cases in (1) customer acquisition, expansion, and retention, (2) marketing communication, and (3) product innovation. By identifying challenges from technological advancement and interactive marketing needs, it characterizes eleven issues that marketers have to deal with. They include the curse of dimensionality, complex data processing, language-image nexus, and customer privacy. This chapter elucidates the DL logic and solution techniques to correspondingly address these issues. It also introduces some technical terms for communication with data scientists. They include generative adversarial networks, transfer learning, and federated learning. A wide range of typical DL models is presented, from simple classification to sophisticated language models. Marketers have to choose from them according to their application matters. This chapter concludes that DL is indispensable to fulfilling today’s customer needs for performance and interactivity. The review shall help formulate DL projects and it can act as a handy reference for exotic marketing innovations upon new technology trends, like the Metaverse. Implications and challenges will be discussed in the ending section. Hopefully, marketers will find DL easier, for implementation or outsourcing.;0;1;Big data | Deep learning | Engagement marketing | Interactive marketing | NLP;2023;Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all) | Business, Management and Accounting (all);101;The Palgrave Handbook of Interactive Marketing

Focusing on text-based, anthropomorphic social chatbots that can be easily implemented on various digital platforms, this chapter synthesizes the literature on computer-mediated communication and human-computer interaction to provide a comprehensive review of the pivotal factors that can enhance chatbots’ perceived humanness and the key considerations in consumer-chatbot interaction and relationship. Specifically, this chapter first discusses the research findings on the persuasiveness of computer-controlled chatbots in relation to human-controlled avatars. Then, the chapter delves into the various anthropomorphic cues used in chatbot design and messaging, including human identity cues, verbal, and non-verbal cues. Strategies and examples for chatbots to communicate humility in order to mitigate consumers’ frustration when chatbots fail to meet consumers’ expectations are also provided. The chapter next addresses some of the most widely studied mediators of chatbot anthropomorphism-social presence and parasocial interaction-and the under-researched role of emotion in consumer-chatbot interactions. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the “uncanny valley” effect pertaining to people’s feelings of eeriness toward highly human-like chatbots.;1;2;Anthropomorphism | Chatbot | Human-Computer Interaction | Social Cues | Uncanny Valley;2023;Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all) | Business, Management and Accounting (all);94;The Palgrave Handbook of Interactive Marketing

We examine the marketplace-relevant consequences of such bias for consumers. Based on billions of documents from online text corpora, we first demonstrate that from gender biases embedded in language, algorithms learn to associate women with more negative consumer psychographic attributes than men (e.g., associating women more closely with impulsive vs. planned investors). Second, in a series of field experiments, we show that such learning results in the delivery of gender-biased digital advertisements and product recommendations. Specifically, across multiple platforms, products, and attributes, we find that digital advertisements containing negative psychographic attributes (e.g., impulsive) are more likely to be delivered to women compared to men, and that search engine product recommendations are similarly biased, which influences consumer's consideration sets and choice. Finally, we empirically examine consumer's role in co-producing algorithmic gender bias in the marketplace and observe that consumers reinforce these biases by accepting gender stereotypes (i.e., clicking on biased ads).

55;57194064921;Wang L.;Wang;School of Business Administration, Northeastern University;Shenyang;China;Research on online shopping contextual cues: refining classification from text mining;Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics;Purpose: Contextual cues have become a hot research topic in the field of mobile consumer behavior, owing to the continuous rise of digital marketing. However, the complex online shopping scene makes it challenging to directly identify the association between the characteristics of contextual cues and consumer behavior. Presently, few studies have only systematically extracted and refined the types and characteristics of contextual cues. The purpose of this study is to explore the types and mechanisms of contextual cues in online shopping scenarios. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the word2vec algorithm, grounded theory and co-occurrence cluster method, along with online shopping word-of-mouth (WOM) text and consumer behavior theory, in order to explore different types of contextual cues and its efficiency from 5,619 comment corpus. Findings: This study puts forward the following conclusions. (1) From the perspective of online shopping, contextual cues comprise aesthetic perception cues, value perception cues, trust-dependent cues, time perception cues, memory attention cues, spatial perception cues, attribute cues and relationship cues. (2) Based on the online shopping scenarios, contextual cues and their interaction effects exert an effect on consumer satisfaction, recommendation, purchase and return behavior. Originality/value: The study conclusions are helpful to further reveal the deep association between contextual cues and consumer behavior in the process of online shopping, thus providing practical and theoretical enlightenment for enterprises to not only effectively reshape the scene but also promote the consumers' active purchase behavior.;0;3;Contextual cues | Online consumer behavior | Online shopping | Perception cues | Text mining;2023;Business and International Management | Strategy and Management | Marketing;72;Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics

Results demonstrate that linguistic features associated with processing ease (e.g., concrete or familiar words) and emotion both play an important role.

Hoping to avoid these returns, box companies ask customers to preview upcoming boxes, evaluate delivered boxes, and justify skipped boxes. The authors are interested in how such extensive customer participation can discourage skipping or, even better, encourage spending. An analysis of 30,000 apparel box customers’ repeated preview, feedback, and purchase behavior reveals that, in addition to whether customers participate, the way in which and when they participate matter, and often in counterproductive ways. Specifically, customer participation with the delivered box drives future purchases, whereas participation before and after the delivered box appears to decrease box opt-in and spending. Further, the double-edged nature of customer participation, especially when such participation involves emotionality, has long-lasting effects, indicating the important role of customer participation dynamics in shaping purchase behavior.;1;3;customer journey | customer participation | dynamics | subscription box | text analysis;2023;Business and International Management | Marketing;48;Journal of Marketing

This information can be useful in market surveillance, digital innovation, or brand improvisation. Automated text mining techniques are being used to understand these data. This study focuses on comparing two common text mining techniques namely: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and evaluates the suitability of the methods in two differing marketing contexts: Reviews from a product category and from a single brand from Amazon. The objectives of review summarization are fundamentally different in these two scenarios. The first scenario can be considered as market surveillance where important aspects of the product category are to be monitored by a particular seller. The second scenario examines a single product, and it is used to monitor in-depth customer opinions of the product. The results support that depending on the objective, the suitability of the technique differs. Different techniques provide different levels of precision and understanding of the content.

Korean cosmetic brand-specific topics were extracted for only Malaysians and were significantly associated with their behavioural responses. Unsuitable Korean beauty products and domestic product preferences were avoidance factors for Indonesians, but new product risks and conflicts between Muslim and Korean cultures for Malaysians.

But why are some communications more impactful? While some argue that content drives success, we suggest that style, or the way ideas are presented, plays an important role. To test style's importance, we examine it in a context where content should be paramount: academic research. While scientists often see writing as a disinterested way to communicate unobstructed truth, a multi-method investigation indicates that writing style shapes impact. To separate content from style, we focus on a unique class of words linked to style (i.e., function words such as “and,” “the,” and “on”) that are devoid of content. Natural language processing of almost 30,000 articles from a range of disciplines finds that function words explain 4–11% of overall variance explained and 11–27% of language content's impact on citations. Additional analyses examine particular style features that may shape success, and why, highlighting the role of writing simplicity, personal voice, and temporal perspective. Experiments further indicate the causal impact of style. The results suggest ways to boost communication's impact and highlight the value of natural language processing for understanding the success of ideas.;1;3;automated textual analysis | language | linguistic style | natural language processing | success of ideas;2023;Applied Psychology | Marketing;66;Journal of Consumer Psychology

Specifically, we analyzed Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to understand how social media users engaged with each term on social media from March 2010 to March 2017. The net sentiment was measured with a sample of over 50 million micro-blogs, and the analysis was done using a combination of digital instruments and human validation. We found a significant difference between the social media engagement and sentiment of both terms, with the ACA performing significantly better than Obamacare, despite Obamacare’s higher conversation volume. With the ACA having an average of 26% less negative sentiment than Obamacare, the findings of this study emphasize the need to be careful when attaching nicknames to public policy.

78;57226113066;Stürmer L.;Stürmer;Universität Wien;Vienna;Austria;Is this advertising or not, and do I care? Perceptions of and opinions regarding hybrid forms of content;Journal of Marketing Communications;As media users are trying to avoid traditional forms of advertising like display ads, companies apply content marketing techniques such as native advertising, sponsored content and company-owned media to reach their audiences. Such hybrid forms of content lead to a blurring of boundaries between editorial content and advertising and are not as easily recognized as promotional. This qualitative study examines consumers’ perspectives and reactions to different types of content marketing products by taking paid and owned media into account. Data from 50 qualitative interviews with media users were analysed by means of thematic qualitative text analysis. The results indicate that consumers often perceive hybrid content as a mix of information and advertising. Advertising recognition is most often based on content-driven characteristics of the message, such as mentioning a product and less so on the advertising disclosure label.

78;12760644200;Einwiller S.;Einwiller;Universität Wien;Vienna;Austria;Is this advertising or not, and do I care? Perceptions of and opinions regarding hybrid forms of content;Journal of Marketing Communications;As media users are trying to avoid traditional forms of advertising like display ads, companies apply content marketing techniques such as native advertising, sponsored content and company-owned media to reach their audiences. Such hybrid forms of content lead to a blurring of boundaries between editorial content and advertising and are not as easily recognized as promotional. This qualitative study examines consumers’ perspectives and reactions to different types of content marketing products by taking paid and owned media into account. Data from 50 qualitative interviews with media users were analysed by means of thematic qualitative text analysis. The results indicate that consumers often perceive hybrid content as a mix of information and advertising. Advertising recognition is most often based on content-driven characteristics of the message, such as mentioning a product and less so on the advertising disclosure label. This study derives four types of content marketing consumers: neutrals, enthusiasts, contemplators and critics. It contributes to the literature by strengthening the understanding of consumers’ perceptions of different types of hybrid content.;1;2;advertising | content marketing | Hybrid content | media literacy | persuasion knowledge;2023;Business and International Management | Marketing;45;Journal of Marketing Communications

Recently, short-form video has also been used for advertising. However, how short-form video for advertisement influences consumer engagement behavior remains unclear. This study aims to explore key features of short-form video advertisements that influence consumer engagement behavior. Through analyzing data obtained from social media platform TikTok, we discovered that four key features of short-form video—performance expectancy, entertainment, tie strength, and sales approach—are significantly related to consumer engagement behavior. In addition, the results showed that product type moderated the relationship of these effects on consumer engagement behavior. This study is one of the first to investigate the influence of short-form video advertisement features on consumer engagement behavior; thus, it contributes to the social media advertisement literature. It extends consumer engagement behavior research by applying a combination of uses and gratifications theory and signal theory. It also highlights the significance of product type in advertising literature. The use of big data and text analysis contributes from a methodological perspective to social media research.

80;57214893486;Wang F.;Wang;China University of Geosciences;Wuhan;China;Designing marketing content for social commerce to drive consumer purchase behaviors: A perspective from speech act theory;Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services;With the emergence of content-driven social commerce, designing marketing content that better stimulates consumer purchase behaviors has become increasingly essential. However, it remains unclear what and how linguistic features of marketing content in emerging social commerce influence consumer purchase behaviors. Drawing on speech act theory, this paper proposes a multi-level research model to conceptualize the linguistic features of content from the aspects of word usage (micro level), within-content argument development (macro level), and between-content linguistic mimicry (meta level), and investigate their impact on consumer purchase behaviors. With a unique dataset that includes 44,256 textual posts from JD WeChat shopping circle (a content-driven social commerce platform), this paper combines text mining methods with a series of regression analyses to test the research model. The empirical analyses find that the number of customers who make a purchase increases 1) at the micro-level due to self-referencing and detailing, 2) at the macro-level due to argument structuring, and 3) at the meta-level due to linguistic style matching, while linguistic content matching negatively affects the number of customers. These findings reveal how content creators strategically use language to design marketing content that encourages consumer purchase behaviors in emerging social commerce. This study has important theoretical contributions and practical implications.;3;4;Consumer purchase behavior | Content marketing | Social commerce | Speech act theory;2023;Marketing;89;Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services

However, the specific impact of COVID-19 on retailers at the customer end has not yet been addressed. Using text-mining techniques (i.e., sentiment analysis, topic modelling) and time series analysis, we analyse 161,921 tweets from leading UK supermarkets during the first COVID-19 lockdown. The results show the causes of sentiment change in each time series and how customer perception changes according to supermarkets’ response actions. Drawing on the social media crisis communication framework and Situational Crisis Communication theory, this study investigates whether responding to a crisis helps retail managers better understand their customers. The results uncover that customers experiencing certain social media interactions may evaluate attributes differently, resulting in varying levels of customer information collection, and grocery companies could benefit from engaging in social media crisis communication with customers. As new variants of COVID-19 keep appearing, emerging managerial problems put businesses at risk for the next crisis. Based on the results of text-mining analysis of consumer perceptions, this study identifies emerging topics in the UK grocery sector in the context of COVID-19 crisis communication and develop the sub-dimensions of service quality assessment into four categories: physical aspects, reliability, personal interaction, and policies. This study reveals how supermarkets could use social media data to better analyse customer behaviour during a pandemic and sustain competitiveness by upgrading their crisis strategies and service provision. It also sheds light on how future researchers can leverage the power of social media data with multiple text-mining methodologies.;5;5;Crisis management | Service quality | Social media crisis communication | Supermarket retailers | Text-mining;2023;Marketing;70;Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services

From this situation arises the issue of separation between the identity that companies want to convey to the public and the image perceived by public. To address this issue, this study analyzes the world 10 top automakers in 2018 regarding their greenness. The tweets posted from the official Twitter accounts of the study companies and those users' tweets posted about them are subjected to text mining. The results for 70% of companies show that there is a significant gap between their claims about their own green identity and how the public perceives such an image.

87;35076857700;Yu B.;Yu;Macao Polytechnic University;Macau;Macao;How consumer opinions are affected by marketers: an empirical examination by deep learning approach;Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing;"Purpose: The natural language processing (NLP) technique enables machines to understand human language. This paper seeks to harness its power to recognise the interaction between marketers and consumers. Hence, this study aims to enhance the conceptual and future development of deep learning in interactive marketing. Design/methodology/approach: This study measures cognitive responses by using actual user postings. Following a typical NLP analysis pipeline with tailored neural network (NN) models, it presents a stylised quantitative method to manifest the underlying relation. Findings: Based on consumer-generated content (CGC) and marketer-generated content (MGC) in the tourism industry, the results reveal that marketers and consumers interact in a subtle way. This study explores beyond simple positive and negative framing, and reveals that they do not resemble each other, not even in abstract form: CGC may complement MGC, but they are incongruent. It validates and supplements preceding findings in the framing effect literature and underpins some marketing wisdom in practice. Research limitations/implications: This research inherits a fundamental limitation of NN model that result interpretability is low. Also, the study may capture the partial phenomenon exhibited by active reviewers; lurker-consumers may behave differently. Originality/value: This research is among the first to explore the interactive aspect of the framing effect with state-of-the-art deep learning language model. It reveals research opportunities by using NLP-extracted latent features to assess textual opinions. It also demonstrates the accessibility of deep learning tools. Practitioners could use the described blueprint to foster their marketing initiatives.";2;1;Big Data | Framing effect | Language model | Market interaction | NLP;2022;Marketing;79;Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing
88;24460372000;Brandes L.;Brandes;Universität Luzern;Luzern;Switzerland;Offline Context Affects Online Reviews: The Effect of Post-Consumption Weather;Journal of Consumer Research;This empirical study investigates whether unpleasant weather - a prominent aspect of a consumer's offline environment - influences online review provision and content. It uses a unique dataset that combines 12 years of data on hotel bookings and reviews, with weather condition information at a consumer's home and hotel address. The results show that bad weather increases review provision and reduces rating scores for past consumption experiences. Moreover, 6.5% more reviews are written on rainy days and that these reviews are 0.1 points lower, accounting for 59% of the difference in average rating scores between four- and five-star hotels in our data. These results are consistent with a scenario in which bad weather (i) induces negative consumer mood, lowering rating scores, and (ii) makes consumers less time-constrained, which increases review provision. Additional analyses with various automated sentiment measures for almost 300,000 review texts support this scenario: reviews on rainy days show a significant reduction in reviewer positivity and happiness, yet are longer and more detailed. This study demonstrates that offline context influences online reviews, and discusses how platforms and businesses should include contextual information in their review management approaches.;1;2;automated text analysis | context effect | mood | online reviews | user-generated content | weather;2022;Business and International Management | Anthropology | Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous) | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;90;Journal of Consumer Research

The survey was completed by 626 respondents and the data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings show that celebrity attachment positively influences actual self-congruence, ideal self-congruence, brand quality, and brand attachment. Brand attachment mediates the effect of celebrity attachment on brand loyalty. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the celebrity endorsement process differs between British and Turkish consumers. Our research complements the meaning transfer model as it confirms that the celebrity endorsement process is influenced by two attachment objects: celebrities and brands. A follow-up study with text mining analysis of the consumer comments about the product reviews posted by social media influencers (SMIs) supported the validity of the celebrity endorsement model.

The study demonstrated an approach for destination marketing organizations to explore online tourist-generated content and to understand tourists' perceptions of the destination image (DI). Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,291,057 reviews (535,317 for Macau and 755,740 for Zhuhai) were collected, analyzed and examined to determine how the DI s of Macau and Zhuhai changed during the period of 2015–2019 based on tourist-generated content on travel websites (TripAdvisor, Ctrip.com and Qyer.com) through a text-mining approach. Findings: The result revealed that Macau and Zhuhai were in a hybrid of competition and collaboration on tourism DI s. First, Macau and Zhuhai competed in hotel and catering industry. Macau was appealing to international tourists and provided high-end and prestigious offerings; while Zhuhai was impressed by cost-effective accommodation and food. Second, Macau diversified industrial structure with diverse “Tourism, Leisure and Recreation” and “Culture, History and Art” more than Zhuhai did. Meanwhile, Macau should balance the different demands of international and Chinese tourists. Third, complementary potentials were found in natural resources, urbanization technology and tourism innovation and related projects. Practical implications: The research provides valuable insights for policymakers and industrial managers on their endeavors to develop DIs. Policymakers should be able to develop supportive mechanisms and tourism facilitators to promote industrial collaboration and mutual DIs. Managers could refer to the components in the changing DIs and identify the developmental gaps and cooperation potentials in their targeted areas. Originality/value: The research fulfills the gap in regional tourism studies on Macau, in which the evaluation on synergetic influence and neighbor effect from Zhuhai has been underexplored. Facilitated by up-to-date data mining techniques, the study contributes to both DI and coopetition literature in tourism marketing; and this should inspire further studies on the antecedences of DI changes, resolutions to the competing interests and DIs of different stakeholders in different forms of strategic cooperation in regional tourism.

The study demonstrated an approach for destination marketing organizations to explore online tourist-generated content and to understand tourists' perceptions of the destination image (DI). Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,291,057 reviews (535,317 for Macau and 755,740 for Zhuhai) were collected, analyzed and examined to determine how the DI s of Macau and Zhuhai changed during the period of 2015–2019 based on tourist-generated content on travel websites (TripAdvisor, Ctrip.com and Qyer.com) through a text-mining approach. Findings: The result revealed that Macau and Zhuhai were in a hybrid of competition and collaboration on tourism DI s. First, Macau and Zhuhai competed in hotel and catering industry. Macau was appealing to international tourists and provided high-end and prestigious offerings; while Zhuhai was impressed by cost-effective accommodation and food. Second, Macau diversified industrial structure with diverse “Tourism, Leisure and Recreation” and “Culture, History and Art” more than Zhuhai did. Meanwhile, Macau should balance the different demands of international and Chinese tourists. Third, complementary potentials were found in natural resources, urbanization technology and tourism innovation and related projects. Practical implications: The research provides valuable insights for policymakers and industrial managers on their endeavors to develop DIs. Policymakers should be able to develop supportive mechanisms and tourism facilitators to promote industrial collaboration and mutual DIs. Managers could refer to the components in the changing DIs and identify the developmental gaps and cooperation potentials in their targeted areas.

Charities often use donation-based crowdfunding platforms to reach out to a wider audience for fundraising campaigns. Key three performance metrics that affect the success of a donation campaign are social media spread of the campaign message, number of donors who decide to donate from seeing the message, and donation amount per donor. This research investigates the effectiveness of negatively framed messages on these three metrics. Analysis of message content of more than 3800 charities on GoFundMe.com via text mining was conducted to form a measure of the negativity of the appeals. Also for each charity, the three performance metrics were collected. Results showed that negatively framed messages led to a greater number of donors and greater sharing of the message on social media, but smaller donation amounts per donor. Implication for charity organizations is that negatively framed messages will be more effective if the goal is to obtain a broad base of support, while positively framed messages will be more effective if the objective is to increase the average donation amount.;0;2;NA;2022;Social Psychology | Applied Psychology;93;Journal of Consumer Behaviour

Based on text data of China's top-ranked Pacific Auto Network, we applied the LDA model, sentiment analysis, text classification, and cluster analysis methods to determine the influencing factors of automobile consumers’ purchasing behavior, identified automobile product defects, and subdivided consumer groups. The results show that the factors affecting consumers’ car buying behavior are low fuel consumption, affordable price, superior performance, fashionable appearance, and comfortable use. Car product defects are mainly reflected in the three aspects of the car's performance, comfort, and configuration; there are six kinds of consumer groups: price seekers, fuel consumption seekers, performance seekers, comfort seekers, cost performance seekers, and appearance seekers. Of these, cost performance seekers make up the largest proportion, and they constitute the largest group of intention purchasers.

How do customers combine a product's technical specifications (i.e., engineered attributes) to form abstract product benefits (i.e., meta-attributes)? To address this question, the authors use machine learning and natural language processing to develop a methodological framework that extracts a hierarchy of product attributes based on contextual information of how attributes are expressed in consumer reviews. The attribute hierarchy reveals linkages between engineered attributes and meta-attributes within a product category, enabling flexible sentiment analysis that can identify how consumers receive meta-attributes, and which engineered attributes are main drivers. The framework can guide managers to monitor only portions of review content that are relevant to specific attributes of interest. Moreover, managers can compare products within and between brands, where different names and attribute combinations are often associated with similar benefits. The authors apply the framework to the tablet computer category to generate dashboards and perceptual maps and provide validations of the attribute hierarchy using both primary and secondary data. Resultant insights allow the exploration of substantive questions, such as how Apple improved successive generations of iPads and why Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba discontinued their tablet product lines.;8;4;attribute embedding | attribute hierarchy | machine learning | meta-attribute | natural language processing | word2vec;2022;Business and International Management | Marketing;55;Journal of Marketing

The authors apply the framework to the tablet computer category to generate dashboards and perceptual maps and provide validations of the attribute hierarchy using both primary and secondary data. Resultant insights allow the exploration of substantive questions, such as how Apple improved successive generations of iPads and why Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba discontinued their tablet product lines.;8;4;attribute embedding | attribute hierarchy | machine learning | meta-attribute | natural language processing | word2vec;2022;Business and International Management | Marketing;55;Journal of Marketing

New service development in the context of emerging markets: a review;International Marketing Review;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to systematically review and critically examine the international marketing and innovation management research on new service development (NSD) in the context of emerging markets (EM). Research on services in EM, a heterogenous set of countries with an increasing contribution to global economic output, is sparse. This paper attempts to underscore the academic and managerial relevance of the field. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of published empirical literature from peer-reviewed journals focusing on an 11-year period, 2010–2020, was undertaken. Further, bibliometric and text mining analyses were conducted using VOSviewer and Leximancer software programmes. Findings: This analysis of 36 journal articles reveals that NSD research is a dynamic field with an increasing number of quantitative, multi-country and multi-method studies encompassing a variety of geographical settings and industries. Originality/value: Doing justice to this vibrant field of research and its managerial importance, the authors create an overview of existing empirical studies to serve as a repository of knowledge on NSD for both academics and practitioners. Further, the authors offer a thematic and temporal overview of the content of existing studies. Drawing upon the abovementioned, the authors suggest some promising avenues for future research.;1;2;Bibliometric analysis | Bottom-of-the-Pyramid | Emerging markets | International marketing | New service development | Service launch | Subsistence marketplaces | Text mining;2022;Business and International Management | Marketing;77;International Marketing Review

But might the way consumers communicate their attitudes (i.e., through speaking or writing) shape the attitudes they express? And, as a result, the impact of what they share? While a great deal of research has begun to examine drivers of word of mouth, there has been less attention to how communication modality might shape sharing. Six studies, conducted in the laboratory and field, demonstrate that compared to speaking, writing leads consumers to express less emotional attitudes. The effect is driven by deliberation. Writing offers more time to deliberate about what to say, which reduces emotionality. The studies also demonstrate a downstream consequence of this effect: by shaping the attitudes expressed, the modality consumers communicate through can influence the impact of their communication.

Evaluating the effect of content and linguistic style similarity on B2B brand engagement;Industrial Marketing Management;Business-to-business (B2B) social media efforts have largely focused on creating brand engagement through online content. We propose to analyse company social media texts (tweets) according to its two main dimensions, content and linguistic style, and to evaluate these in comparison to the overall content and style of the company's community of Twitter followers. We combine 15 million tweets originating from 254,884 followers of ten company profiles and link these to 10,589 B2B company tweets. Using advanced text analytics, we show that content similarity has positive effects on all engagement metrics, while linguistic style similarity mainly affects likes. Readability acts as a moderator for these effects. We also find a negative interaction effect between the similarity metrics, such that style similarity is most useful if content similarity is low. This research is the first to integrate content and linguistic style similarity and contributes to the brand engagement literature by providing practical message composition guidelines, informed by the social media community.;2;4;B2B | Brand engagement | Content matching | Linguistic style matching | Social media | Text analytics;2022;Marketing;71;Industrial Marketing Management

From its early development to the present, consumer researchers have adopted different methods and followed different approaches to describe the consumption phenomena. By pursuing a probabilistic approach, the current study aims to provide in-depth insight into consumer behavior research's evolution and transformation between 1980 and 2020. The results exhibit a strong increase on subjects like consumer trust, self-identity, digital consumption, social media engagement, consumer culture theory, consumer motivation, and brand-consumer relationships. The citation analysis shows the most impactful articles and topics in consumer behavior research. The results indicate that articles on customer service satisfaction, experiential consumption, consumer trust, digital consumption, and social media engagement tend are heavily cited. And to understand each journals contribution an analysis based on citations, journal impact and topical diversity is also included.

For example, they are claimed to be not in line with the Shari‘ah (Islamic law). Furthermore, the existing scholarly works have not much gained knowledge from the local IBs explaining their efforts in promoting maqasid al-Shariah (objectives of Islamic law). Hence, because religiosity drives the fundamental establishment of IBs, this paper aims to explore the knowledge of how IBs in Indonesia promote maqasid al-Shariah via their published reports. Design/methodology/approach: This paper performs text mining from 24 official reports of 5 IBs in Indonesia published from 2015 to 2017. The sample contains 7,162 digital pages and approximately 3,021,618 words. Traditional text mining via human intelligence is first performed to analyse for the numerical data required in the maqasid al-Shariah index (MSI) analysis. Furthermore, a computer-driven text mining using the ‘Text Search’ feature of NVivo 12 Plus is conducted to perform qualitative analysis. These approaches are made to gain relevant knowledge of how the sampled IBs promote maqasid al-Shariah from their published reports. Findings: The analysis using the MSI explains a quantified maqasid al-Shariah on the sample’s performance, which indictes the lowest and the highest performing banks. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis supports the evidence from the quantitative analysis. It explains the authors’ coding process that results in 2 parent nodes and 20 child nodes, which contain 435 references coded from the sampled unstructured and bilingual texts. These nodes explain the information that associates with maqasid al-Shariah from the IBs’ reports. These findings explain how maqasid al-Shariah is measured mathematically and represent relevant knowledge of how maqasid al-Shariah is informed practically via digital texts. Research limitations/implications: A positivist generalisation is neither intended nor established in this study. Practical implications: This paper gains relevant knowledge of how the sampled IBs in Indonesia control and maintain the implementation of maqasid al-Shariah from large textual data. Such knowledge is practically important for IBs stakeholders in Indonesia; moreover to help navigate the Shari‘ah identity of Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI), the new IB established from the merger of 3 state-owned IBs, which are among the sample of this study. Social implications: This paper provides evidence that might best challenge the subjective issue of IBs claiming that they are not in line with the Shari‘ah, particularly in Indonesia. Originality/value: This paper is among the pioneers that discover knowledge of how IBs promote maqasid al-Shariah in Indonesia’s banking sector via a text mining approach.";12;2;Banking performance | Indonesia | Islamic bank | Maqashid al-Shariah | Text mining;2022;Marketing;64;Journal of Islamic Marketing

This study analyzed more than 50 K salespersons' social media posts on the job review website Glassdoor.com to identify the types of stories B2B salespeople tell about their jobs and employers. Building on narrative theory, we used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) – a dictionary-based content analysis tool – to score the “W5” elements (who, what, when, where, and why) that constitute stories. Next, we analyzed differences in the patterns of language used and uncovered four clusters representing corporate cultures that we characterize as cultures of Work Rewards, Work-Life Balance, Workplace Malaise, and Toxic Interactions.

Drawing on conceptualizations of rhetorical signals and the principles on cooperative communication, this study uses technology licensing contracts to investigate how contractual terms and formulations lead to investor reactions (i.e., licensee's market value). Using automated text analysis, we demonstrate how monitoring and enforcement emphasis can be usefully retrieved from contractual text. Substantially we show that greater monitoring (enforcement) emphasis increases (decreases) the licensees' market value. Greater concreteness reverses these effects of greater monitoring (enforcement) emphasis on the licensee's market value. Combined, the three-way effect of monitoring emphasis, enforcement emphasis, and concreteness generates the greatest increase in the licensee's market value. These insights provide guidance for licensees on how best to formulate their licensing contracts. We show how to conduct automated text analyses to advance research in the area.;3;4;Automated text analysis | Contracts | Enforcement | Monitoring | Technology licensing;2022;Marketing;129;Industrial Marketing Management

A longitudinal essay in Lisbon;Consumer Behavior in Tourism and Hospitality;Purpose: Considering the importance of the content created by the host for Airbnb consumers while making purchasing decisions, this study aims to analyze how the Airbnb hosts promote their properties by revealing the predominant attributes considered by hosts when advertising them. Design/methodology/approach: The unstructured textual content of online Airbnb accommodations advertisements (property descriptions) is analyzed through a longitudinal text mining approach. This study defines a pipeline based on a topic modeling approach that allows not only to identity the most prevalent text attributes but also its distribution through time. Findings: This research identifies and characterizes the attributes most advertised over time, on about 30,000 accommodations posted monthly over two years, between 2018 and 2020. Five main topics were identified in the data reflecting only pull motivations. Noteworthy is the slight changes in properties’ descriptions topics along the two years, suggesting that “service” is increasingly being perceived by hosts as an important attribute of Airbnb guest experience. Originality/value: Through a text analysis, this study provides an insight into peer-to-peer accommodation on the key attributes that hosts consider in the description of their properties to leverage the attractiveness of Airbnb. In the light of existing research, which has predominantly focused on the trustworthiness and attractiveness of the Airbnb advertisement, this research differentiates by analyzing the main attributes in text over time. Given the Airbnb’s changes since its inception, a longitudinal view is relevant to clarify how hosts advertise their properties and how it evolves in the light of these changes.;0;4;Airbnb | Hosts advertisements | Push and pull factors | Sharing economy | Topic modeling;2022;Geography, Planning and Development | Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management;44;Consumer Behavior in Tourism and Hospitality

The working-paper also aims to investigate the differences between reviews written by men and women. Design/methodology/approach: A combined sentiment and text analysis was applied to 329,849 UK hotel reviews from UK TripAdvisor to identify factors that influence customer satisfaction, including those with gender differences. Findings: The present findings reveal important differences between the male- and female-produced terms. The results show that female travelers pay more attention to the hotel’s core products and their comfort compared to male travelers. In terms of food and beverage, men’s comments tended to focus on pubs, beer and certain types of food. In contrast, women’s comments were more likely to be related to healthy eating, such as homemade, vegan and vegetarian foods, as well as fruits and healthy breakfasts. Women also pay more attention to the soft skills of staff such as friendliness, helpfulness and welcoming messages. Practical implications: While core attributes of a hotel stay remain crucial for all guests, disparities exist between the language men and women use to describe them. For core products, women pay more attention to the room’s cleanliness, comfort and features such as bed, pillow, blanket, towel, toiletries and decoration, whereas men pay more attention to the layout, size and type of room. Hotels may use gender as a segmentation variable and use these findings in their marketing campaigns. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies offering insights into the differences between the male and female reactions to and preferences for hotel services at a national level.

114;56328446100;Lopez A.;Lopez;Tecnológico de Monterrey;Monterrey;Mexico;Do sensory reviews make more sense? The mediation of objective perception in online review helpfulness;Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing;Purpose: Do consumers rate reviews describing other consumers' sensory experience of a product (touch, smell, sight, hear and taste) as helpful or do they rate reviews describing more practical properties (product performance and characteristics/features) as more helpful? What is the effect of review helpfulness on purchase intention? Furthermore, why do consumers perceive sensory and non-sensory reviews differently? This study answers these questions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze 447,792 Amazon reviews and perform a topic modeling analysis to extract the main topics that consumers express in their reviews. Then, the topics were used as regressors to predict the number of consumers who found the review helpful. Finally, a lab experiment was conducted to replicate the results in a more controlled environment to test the serial mediation effect. Findings: Contrary to the overwhelming evidence supporting the positive effects of sensory elicitation in marketing, this study shows that sensory reviews are less likely to be helpful than non-sensory reviews. Moreover, a key reason why sensory reviews are less effective is that they decrease the objective perception of the review, a less objective review then decreases the level of helpfulness, which decreases purchase intention. Originality/value: This study contributes to the interactive marketing field by investigating customer behavior and interactivity in online shopping sites and to the sensory marketing literature by identifying a boundary condition, the authors’ data suggest that sensory elicitations might not be processed positively by consumers when they are not directly experienced, but instead communicated by another consumer. Moreover, this study indicates how companies can encourage consumers to share more effective and helpful reviews.;12;2;Data analytics | Electronic commerce | Online consumer behavior | Online marketing | Online shopping | Text mining;2022;Marketing;51;Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing

So far, papers studying online reviews have mainly analysed how non-textual features, such as ratings and volume, influence different types of consumer behavior, such as information adoption decisions or product choices. However, little attention has been paid to examining the textual aspects of online reviews in order to study brand image and brand positioning. The text analysis of online reviews inevitably raises the concept of “text mining”; that is, the process of extracting useful and meaningful information from unstructured text. This research proposes an unified, structured and easy-to-implement procedure for the text analysis of online reviews with the ultimate goal of studying brand image and brand positioning. The text mining analysis is based on a lexicon-based approach, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (Pennebaker et al., 2007), which provides the researcher with insights into emotional and psychological brand associations.";18;3;Brand positioning | eWOM | Online reviews | Text mining;2022;Marketing;107;Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services
116;55578548500;Ludwig S.;Ludwig;NA;NA;NA;Communication in the Gig Economy: Buying and Selling in Online Freelance Marketplaces;Journal of Marketing;The proliferating gig economy relies on online freelance marketplaces, which support relatively anonymous interactions through text-based messages. Informational asymmetries thus arise that can lead to exchange uncertainties between buyers and freelancers. Conventional marketing thought recommends reducing such uncertainty. However, uncertainty reduction and uncertainty management theories indicate that buyers and freelancers might benefit more from balancing—rather than reducing—uncertainty, such as by strategically adhering to or deviating from common communication principles. With dyadic analyses of calls for bids and bids from a leading online freelance marketplace, this study reveals that buyers attract more bids from freelancers when they provide moderate degrees of task information and concreteness, avoid sharing personal information, and limit the affective intensity of their communication. Freelancers’ bid success and price premiums increase when they mimic the degree of task information and affective intensity exhibited by buyers. However, mimicking a lack of personal information and concreteness reduces freelancers’ success, so freelancers should always be more concrete and offer more personal information than buyers. These contingent perspectives offer insights into buyer–seller communication in two-sided online marketplaces. They clarify that despite, or sometimes due to, communication uncertainty, both sides can achieve success in the online gig economy.;7;7;business-to-business exchange | gig economy | multisided platforms | online freelance marketplaces | text analysis | uncertainty management;2022;Business and International Management | Marketing;82;Journal of Marketing

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method approach that comprises two distinct yet complementary studies. The first uses quantitative methods and is based on a sample of 35,264 retail banking customers. Study 2 explores the findings that emerge from Study 1 using qualitative methods. Findings: This paper finds that matching consumer personality with congruent advertising messages can lead to more effective consumer persuasion for most personality types. For consumers who exhibit neurotic personality traits, ameliorating perceived risks during purchasing and providing cues for social acceptance and goal attainment are important factors for advertising effectiveness. These factors also had a positive impact on the purchasing behaviour of extroverted consumers. Research limitations/implications: This research focusses on understanding purchasing behaviour based on the most dominant personality trait. However, people are likely to exhibit a combination of most or even all of the Big Five personality traits. Practical implications: Building on advances in natural language processing, enabling the identification of personality from language, this study demonstrates the possibility of influencing consumer behaviour by matching machine inferred personality to congruent persuasive advertising. It is one of the few studies to use contextual instead of social media data to capture individual personality. Such data serves to capture an authentic rather than contrived persona. Further, the study identifies the factors that may moderate this relationship and thereby provides an explanation of why some personality traits exhibit differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are anticipated by existing theory. Originality/value: Although the idea that people are more likely to be responsive to advertising messages that are congruent with their personality type has already been successfully applied by advertising practitioners and documented by advertising scholars, this study extends existing research by identifying the factors that may moderate this relationship and thereby provides an explanation why some personality traits may exhibit differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are anticipated by existing theory.";7;3;Advertising | Artificial intelligence | Machine learning | Personality | Personality traits;2022;Marketing;84;European Journal of Marketing

First, in contrast to methods that rely on word frequency, they develop a deep learning convolutional–long short-term memory hybrid model to account for language structure. The convolutional layer accounts for spatial structure (adjacent word groups or phrases), and long short-term memory accounts for the sequential structure of language (sentiment distributed and modified across nonadjacent phrases). Second, they address the problem of missing attributes in text when constructing attribute sentiment scores, as reviewers write about only a subset of attributes and remain silent on others. They develop a model-based imputation strategy using a structural model of heterogeneous rating behavior. Using Yelp restaurant review data, they show superior attribute sentiment scoring accuracy with their model. They identify three reviewer segments with different motivations: status seeking, altruism/want voice, and need to vent/praise. Surprisingly, attribute mentions in reviews are driven by the need to inform and vent/praise rather than by attribute importance. The heterogeneous model-based imputation performs better than other common imputations and, importantly, leads to managerially significant corrections in restaurant attribute ratings.

The theories also suggest that consumers in different cultures may respond to COVID-19 differently. To test our hypotheses, we implemented a Python scraper to collect companies’ Instagram posts pre- and during the COVID-19 lockdown. A machine learning algorithm was applied on the collected post photos to automatically identify certain photo characteristics, such as indoor versus outdoor, and with a single person versus many people; a text mining and sentiment analysis was implemented on the collected post captions to identify the salient emotion each caption exhibited, such as joy and anticipation. After that, we conducted a regression discontinuity analysis of photo characteristics or caption emotion on number of likes or comments to identify consumers’ response change due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We adopt an n-gram language model to analyze narratives of over 21,000 film projects from Kickstarter and find that the choice of words is critical to crowdfunding success. Using penalized logistic regression, we identify the relative power of phrases to predict funding outcome, resulting in a dramatic reduction in error rate. Consistent with the language expectancy theory, the linguistic analyses show that successful projects usually include words that reflect the credibility of project creators and meaningful social interactions, whereas failed projects exude negativism or uncertainty. While good word choices vary among movie genres, words of lower cognitive complexity dampen the chances of funding. These findings have broad implications for text analysis and natural language generation for persuasive marketing communications.;6;4;Crowdfunding | Language expectancy theory (LET) | Natural language processing (NLP) | Promotion pitch | Text mining;2022;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;30;Marketing Letters

Consistent with the language expectancy theory, the linguistic analyses show that successful projects usually include words that reflect the credibility of project creators and meaningful social interactions, whereas failed projects exude negativism or uncertainty. While good word choices vary among movie genres, words of lower cognitive complexity dampen the chances of funding.

The authors use the output of topic models at the brand level to evaluate similarities between brands and to identify potential cobrand partners. In addition to using average topic probabilities to assess brands’ relationships to each other, they incorporate a differential language analysis framework, which implements scientific inference with multi-test-corrected hypothesis testing, to evaluate positive and negative topic correlates of brand names. The authors highlight the various applications of these approaches in decision making for brand management, including the assessment of brand positioning and future cobranding partnerships, design of marketing communication, identification of new product introductions, and identification of potential negative brand associations that can pose a threat to a brand's image. Moreover, they introduce a new metric, “temporal topic variability,” that can serve as an early warning of future changes in consumer preference.

Previous research acknowledges that lobbying positively influences firm value, but no studies have examined the parallel effects for customers. Building on the attention-based view (ABV) of the firm, the authors examine these customer effects. Findings reveal that lobbying negatively affects customer satisfaction such that the positive relationship between lobbying and firm value is mediated by losses to customer satisfaction. These findings suggest a dark side of lobbying and challenge current thinking. However, several customer-focused moderators attenuate the negative effect of lobbying on customer satisfaction, predicted by ABV theory, including the chief executive officer’s background (marketing vs. other functional area) and the firm’s strategic use of resources (advertising spending, research-and-development spending, or lobbying for product market issues). These moderators ensure consistency between lobbying and customer priorities or direct firm attention toward customers even while firms continue to lobby. Finally, the authors verify that lobbying reduces the firm’s customer focus by measuring this focus directly using text analysis of firm communications with shareholders. Collectively, the research provides managerial implications for navigating both lobbying activities and customer priorities, and public policy implications for lobbying disclosure requirements.;7;4;attention-based view | corporate political activity | customer satisfaction | lobbying | regulation;2022;Business and International Management | Marketing;96;Journal of Marketing

A priming experiment on organic food;International Journal of Consumer Studies;"Consumers are increasingly sharing their opinions on societal issues and products online. We studied the implications of such online word-of-mouth for consumer judgement and decision-making. The case used is organic food, which is the most successful among the currently emerging, sustainability-differentiated food product categories. We first analysed the online discussion on organic food by conducting a text-mining study of reader comments (N = 63,379) from the comments section of a major German online news outlet. Topics therein are discussed with differing frequency, thereby indicating the salience of the various issues to online readers and consumers. One organic food topic of high salience (animal welfare) and one of low salience (biodiversity) were selected to investigate the behavioural relevance of salient online topics in a subsequent priming experiment (online survey of German consumers; N = 1,118). In particular, we tested whether the relative online salience of the two topics used as primes influenced the likelihood of choosing organic instead of conventional eggs and milk in a choice experiment and the acceptance of policies supporting organic farming. Although ineffective for the choice of milk, the priming worked as hypothesized regarding the choice of eggs and policy acceptance. Priming the topic with high online salience is more effective at promoting pro-organic behaviour than priming the topic with low online salience. Priming effects also depended on prime strength, attitude strength and experience with buying organic food. We discuss how insights from text mining of online word-of-mouth can be employed to promote sustainable consumption behaviour.";4;2;associative network | consumer choices | organic food | priming | salience | text mining;2022;Applied Psychology | Economics and Econometrics | Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health | Marketing;90;International Journal of Consumer Studies

Design/methodology/approach: This systematic review, guided by the PRISMA framework, takes a multi-disciplinary approach to identify 310 articles published between 2010 and 2019 examining consumers experiencing vulnerability. Descriptive analysis of the data is undertaken in combination with a thematic and text mining approach using Leximancer software. Findings: A definition of consumers experiencing vulnerability is developed- “unique and subjective experiences where characteristics such as states, conditions and/or external factors lead to a consumer experiencing a sense of powerlessness in consumption settings”. The findings reveal consumers experiencing vulnerability have often been classified using a uni-dimensional approach (opposed to a multi-dimensional), focussing on one factor of vulnerability, the most prevalent of these being economic and age factors. A lack of research has examined consumers experiencing vulnerability based upon geographical remoteness, gender and sexual exploitation. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to examine consumers experiencing vulnerability using a systematic approach and text mining analysis to synthesise a large set of articles, which subsequently reduces the potential for researchers’ interpretative bias. Further, it is the first to generate a data-driven definition of consumers experiencing vulnerability. It provides targeted recommendations to allow further scholarly, policy and practical contributions to this area.;18;4;Consumers experiencing vulnerability | Social marketing | Systematic review | Transformative | Well-being;2022;Marketing;59;Journal of Services Marketing

Design/methodology/approach: This systematic review, guided by the PRISMA framework, takes a multi-disciplinary approach to identify 310 articles published between 2010 and 2019 examining consumers experiencing vulnerability. Descriptive analysis of the data is undertaken in combination with a thematic and text mining approach using Leximancer software. Findings: A definition of consumers experiencing vulnerability is developed- “unique and subjective experiences where characteristics such as states, conditions and/or external factors lead to a consumer experiencing a sense of powerlessness in consumption settings”.

131;57581272300;Zaremba A.;Zaremba;Otomoto KLIK;NA;Poland;Hidden online customer journey: How unseen activities affect media mix modelling and multichannel attribution;Journal of Digital and Social Media Marketing;The purpose of this paper is to verify the impact of missing the earned media and category media in multichannel conversion attribution models on digital media budget allocation. The analysis is based on a very unique approach: 532 users who declared their will to purchase a selected product in the next 3–5 months agreed to install special add-ons on all their devices connected to the Internet. These devices will register all the users’ activities throughout three months. All user activities on the path to purchase were extracted by means of text mining (URL analysis) techniques. Finally, 5,171 activities were found and assigned to particular media areas and media channels. The average user spends 20 per cent of their time in the paid media and owned media areas. However, from the point of view of the number of touchpoints, 29 per cent of the activities occur in these two areas. The obtained results clearly show how much of consumers’ activity in the decision-making process is beyond the control of marketers who, on the basis of this partial data, have to make daily decisions about allocating advertising budgets. The study compared the results of conversion attribution for the full funnel (paid media, owned media, earned media, category media) with the conversion attribution based only on paid media and owned media. The results indicate that not all attribution models lead to similar conclusions in both approaches.;1;1;budgeting | decision making | measures | media planning | multichannel attribution;2022;Communication | Marketing;50;Journal of Digital and Social Media Marketing

It is important to understand the consumer perspective on newly introduced electric cars, such as those of Turkey’s Automobile Joint Venture Group Inc. (TOGG). Thus, the purpose of this study is to provide a better understanding of consumers’ perceptions related to the newly introduced TOGG, which may create a competitive advantage. Social media is an abundant source of textual data that allows for very reliable analysis and understanding of consumer opinions. In this study, Twitter comments on TOGG were collected and studied. Text mining, sentiment analysis and topic model analysis were then conducted. The results show that TOGG is a popular product with the public: there are many more positive Twitter comments related to TOGG than negative ones. The topics identified in social media are price expectancy, production facility, design and features.

In life, business, sports, and politics, social media facilitates the democratization of ideas like never before. Social media content gives consumers different information sources that they must decipher to discern its trustworthiness and influence in their own opinions. Marketers must be savvy about using social media in their attempts to persuade consumers and build brand equity. As social media has permeated our everyday lives, scholars in various disciplines are actively conducting research into this aspect regarding our way of life. In this scholarly endeavor, marketing has taken a leading role in this research endeavor as a discipline involving human communications and idea persuasion. Thus, rather than considering social media broadly across multiple disciplines, in this monograph, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing. This monograph comprises the following four sections: • First, we provide an overview of social media and social media analytics (SMA). While much has already been said about social media generally, relatively less has been said about social media analytics. Thus, much of our focus is on SMA in terms of contributing to the current understanding of SMA in the field. • Second, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing. We discuss practical industry perspectives and examples, as well as recent marketing research by academics. Notably, we show how analytics may be used to address concerns about social media privacy and help detect fake reviews. • Third, we summarize common tools for social media analytics in marketing. These methods can be complex, but they must be mastered for sound SMA practice. They encompass big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, text analytics, and visual analytics. • Fourth, we discuss trends and a future research agenda. We also discuss how SMA might be better integrated into higher education.;3;2;NA;2022;Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;183;Foundations and Trends in Marketing

134;56469611500;Gelter J.;Gelter;Mid Sweden University, Östersund;Ostersund;Sweden;Making sense of smart tourism destinations: A qualitative text analysis from Sweden;Journal of Destination Marketing and Management;The concept of smart tourism destinations has gained increased attention in research literature and among tourism stakeholders. However, the concept is still considered in need of more in-depth explanations for understanding and making sense of the notion. The contribution of the concept of smart tourism destinations to managerially relevant knowledge is particularly difficult to assess due to its complexity. Therefore, a qualitative text analysis of stakeholder interviews is proposed and conducted using the GABEK® methodology to identify recurring themes in the stakeholders' understanding of smart tourism destinations. The GABEK® methodology aims to represent the texts of open interviews as networks of interrelated keywords to make sense of a complex phenomenon. This study explores how destination stakeholders from two different Swedish destinations make sense of the concept of smart tourism destinations. Study findings show that, from the destination stakeholders' point of view, there is a need to counterbalance the currently dominant focus on technology with softer though more existential values to construct a sustainable path of destination development.

Marketing researchers have employed various methods for analyzing text reviews but lack a comprehensive comparison of their performance to guide method selection in future applications. We focus on the fundamental relationship between a consumer's overall empirical evaluation, and the text-based explanation of their evaluation. We study the empirical tradeoff between predictive and diagnostic abilities, in applying various methods to estimate this fundamental relationship. We incorporate methods previously employed in the marketing literature, and methods that are so far less common in the marketing literature. For generalizability, we analyze 25,241 products in nine product categories, and 260,489 reviews across five review platforms. We find that neural network-based machine learning methods, in particular pre-trained versions, offer the most accurate predictions, while topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation offer deeper diagnostics. However, neural network models are not suited for diagnostic purposes and topic models are ill equipped for making predictions. Consequently, future selection of methods to process text reviews is likely to be based on analysts’ goals of prediction versus diagnostics.;24;4;Automated text analysis | Machine learning | Natural language processing | Online reviews | Sentiment analysis | User generated content;2022;Marketing;56;International Journal of Research in Marketing

This paper develops a methodological framework to address strategic decision-making processes from a multi-criteria perspective, assisted by text analytics and interviews. The framework comprises five stages and 12 steps, and is empirically tested in a decision scenario involving a strategic focus for future analytics initiatives in order to stimulate value generation from analytics. The proposed framework enables the discovery, validation, and prioritisation of strategic patterns from relevant interview data. Among six decision alternatives discovered in the validation scenario, customer analytics was the strategic focus most relevant to future analytics initiatives.

Major online retailers help customers choose the right product by exposing reviews that received many “helpful” votes at the top of the review section. Given that reviews that have received the maximum helpfulness votes are considered more important in purchase decisions, understanding determinants of helpfulness votes offers clear benefits to online retailers and review platforms. This study focuses on the effect of review informativeness, which is measured by the number of attributes discussed in a review, and its interplay of review valence on customers' perception of review helpfulness. We applied a word-level bigram analysis to derive product attributes from review text and examined the influence of the number of attributes on the review's helpfulness votes. More importantly, we also suggested the moderating role of review valence. Estimation results of the Zero-inflated Poisson models on 21,125 reviews across 14 wireless earbuds indicated that as more attributes are discussed in a review, the more the review can earn helpfulness votes from customers. Furthermore, the positive association between the number of attributes and helpfulness was enhanced among negative reviews. This study contributes to customers' information processing literature and offers guidelines to online retailers in designing a better decision support system.;19;2;Big data analysis | Bigram analysis | Multi-attribute reviews | Review helpfulness | Review informativeness;2022;Marketing;52;Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services

We use text-mining techniques to extract Airbnb hosts' motivations from their responses to the question ""why did you start hosting.""We find that hosts are driven not only by the monetary motivation ""to earn cash""but also by intrinsic motivations such as ""to share beauty""and ""to meet people.""Using extensive transaction-level data, we find that hosts with intrinsic motivations post more property photos and write longer property descriptions, demonstrating greater engagement with the platform. Consequently, these hosts receive higher guest satisfaction ratings. Compared to hosts who want to earn cash, hosts motivated to meet people are more likely to keep hosting and to stay active on the platform, and hosts motivated to share beauty charge higher prices. As a result, these intrinsically motivated hosts have a higher customer lifetime value compared to those with a monetary motivation. We employ a multimethod approach including text mining, Bayesian latent attrition models, and lab experiments to derive these insights.

139;57210604639;Narang U.;Narang;NA;NA;NA;The “Idea Advantage”: How Content Sharing Strategies Impact Engagement in Online Learning Platforms;Journal of Marketing Research;In recent years, online learning platforms (e.g., Coursera, edX) have experienced massive growth and have reached nearly 200 million learners. Although their reach is quite large, the impact of these platforms is constrained by a low level of learner engagement. In traditional face-to-face classrooms, educators aim to engage learners by asking them to participate in class discussions and share information about their identity and ideas. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in online learning platforms is uncertain. The authors examine this issue by assessing the impact of two different types of content sharing on learner engagement. The authors conduct a textual analysis of over 12,000 text postings during an 18-month period (Study 1) and a field experiment among over 2,000 learners (Study 2) in a popular Coursera offering by a large U.S. university. The results indicate that asking learners to share ideas (vs. their identity) has a stronger effect on their video consumption and assessment completion. The authors explain this “idea advantage” by suggesting that learners who share ideas (vs. identity) exhibit a greater degree of elaboration. This idea advantage is strongest for learners from English-speaking countries and those new to online learning.;8;3;education | engagement | field experiment | online platforms | student retention and performance | text mining | topic modeling | user-generated content;2022;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;66;Journal of Marketing Research

Design/methodology/approach: This study employed text mining techniques. A total of 1,168 relevant magazine articles published from 2013 to 2020 were collected and then categorized according to their tones. In total, 36 topics were identified by reviewing the sustainability issues in the industry. The frequency of each topic mentioned in the articles and the correlation coefficients between topics' frequencies and published time were calculated. The results were used to examine if the three sustainability dimensions (environment, society, economy) were equally addressed and identify opportunities in the sustainability implementation process. Findings: There were much fewer social and economic topics than environmental topics discussed in the articles. Additionally, there were not enough practices developed to reduce microfiber pollution, improve consumers' knowledge of sustainability, offset the carbon footprint, build a transparent, sustainable supply chain and avoid animal cruelty. Originality/value: There is a lack of research focusing on the whole supply chain and sustainability when investigating sustainable practices and topic trends. This study fills a part of the gap. The results can be used by industrialists to identify sustainable practice opportunities and better manage their sustainable supply chains. Researchers can utilize the results to compare the topics in the industry with the topics studied in academia.;8;2;Magazine articles | Supply chain | Sustainability | Text mining | Textile and apparel industry | Topic trends;2022;Business and International Management | Marketing;53;Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management

Because NLP is a large, diverse, and rapidly evolving field, we will begin with a brief, pragmatic overview of the discipline, with an emphasis on key historical and current methods and applications. We will then briefly discuss the linguistic perspective and its application to sensory evaluation, with an aim to motivating the remaining chapter. Following that, we will discuss key areas of NLP, from data collection to processing to analysis to advanced applications.

Specifically, this paper uncovers all published studies having latent issues with the keywords “relic tourism” from the Web of Science database. Methods: A total of 109 published articles (2002-2021) were collected related to “relic tourism.” Machine learning tools were applied. Network analysis was used to highlight top researchers in this field, their citations, keyword clusters, and collaborative networks. Text analysis and Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT) of artificial intelligence model were used to predict text or keyword-based topic reference in machine learning. Results: All the papers are published basically on three primary keywords such as “relics,” “culture,” and “heritage.” Secondary keywords like “protection” and “development” also attract researchers to research this topic. The co-author network is highly significant for diverse authors, and geographically researchers from five countries are collaborating more on this topic. Implications: Academically, future research can be predicated with dense keywords. Journals can bring more special issues related to the topic as relic tourism still has some unexplored areas.;9;4;artificial intelligence | machine learning | relic tourism | Text analysis | topic modelling;2022;Geography, Planning and Development | Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management | Marketing;58;Journal of Tourism, Heritage and Services Marketing

Among the latter, co-branding has recently become pervasive in the luxury fashion sector. Despite the growing interest in co-branding, no study to date has examined how luxury fashion brands can strategically combine different types of co-branding and the amount of media visibility that they can gain by means of these brand alliances. Drawing on both case study analysis and automated text analysis, this paper on the longitudinal case of the luxury fashion brand Off-White offers important managerial implication. It shows that, to create a successful co-branding portfolio, luxury brands should initially collaborate with renowned brands in the same target market, and only later with brands operating in other sectors.

Additionally, the research focus may differ from the influence of digital technology. Therefore, this study draws on a review of 439 GCB articles that focus on social roles and utilizes both quantitative and qualitative analyses to provide a general picture of theories, social factors, research topics and topic trends with a specific emphasis on the research differences between the traditional and digital contexts. The findings indicate that the GCB field has experienced exponential growth since 2014. Subjective norms, social influence, culture, marketing influence and social media influence are the main drivers of GCB. Eight research topics are identified, among which topics on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the theory of consumption values (TCV) maintained high popularity. Furthermore, the TPB is more prevalent in the traditional context in which scholars prefer to predict GCB using macrosocial factors, such as policy and culture. In comparison, signal theory and commitment-trust theory have received more attention in the digital context in which trust is vital. Research interests in online platforms and green hotels have recently increased in the digital context. Gaps and suggested directions for future studies are further identified.;2;4;bibliometric analysis | content analysis | green consumer behaviour | social roles | text mining | traditional versus digital contexts;2022;Applied Psychology | Economics and Econometrics | Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health | Marketing;250;International Journal of Consumer Studies

Such appeals are widespread in marketing, including advertising copy, RFP responses, call center scripts, product descriptions, and many others. Although marketing research has produced several tools to help managers glean insights from online word-of-mouth, less attention has been paid to creating tools to assist the innumerable marketers responsible for crafting effective marketing messages. Our approach leverages the hierarchical structure of written works, associating words with sentences and sentences with documents, and the linguistic relationships developed therein. We score each sentence in an appeal by its expected contribution to success accounting for its substance and persuasive impact. The sentences with the lowest scores make the appeal less compelling and are the most effective points to focus a revision. The approach has proved effective in a randomized control trial, with subjects rating essays revised with the aid of algorithmic feedback as being 4.5% more likely to achieve their objec-tives. In addition to providing automated feedback to authors, we leverage the model’s output to derive substantive insights into what makes an appeal compelling.;2;2;creative appeals | deep learning | natural language processing | recurrent neural networks;2022;Business and International Management | Marketing;54;Marketing Science

153;57823168200;Yao A.;Yao;Fowler College of Business;San Diego;United States;Communication during pandemic: who should tweet about COVID and how?;Journal of Strategic Marketing;The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the health and wealth of individuals and economies. Firms have lost businesses while people have lost their jobs and even lives because of the pandemic. Hence, it is critical to understand whether and how firms should communicate with their consumers. The author analyzes social media tweets from 35 major car companies for 21 months during the pandemic, and detects different COVID-tweeting effects between luxury and non-luxury brands. While firms often spend much effort providing COVID-19 related information during pandemic, this paper finds that tweeting about COVID-19 (relative to other content) generally hurts consumer engagement (i.e. decreases retweets). Interestingly, this negative effect is moderated if tweets are posted by luxury firms (vs. non-luxury firms). Last, if firms tweet about COVID-19, they should focus more on stakeholders, such as consumers and employees in their tweets. The author generates implications for social media strategies during tremendous uncertainty and crisis periods.;3;1;consumer engagement | covid-19 | luxury brand | Marketing communication | text analysis | twitter;2022;Strategy and Management | Marketing;67;Journal of Strategic Marketing

The research adds to AI and text analysis approaches by considering the whole meaning of a post rather than an analysis of subsets of information in text and other media. The use of MSLA is validated across the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The findings show that MSLA helps (i) reveal structures in what appear to be unstructured multimodal posts; (ii) identify all the sentiment items in a post; (iii) identify implicit meanings, such as irony, humour and sarcasm; and (iv) further identify emotions and judgements in multimodal communication.

These rankings are based on different criteria directly related to research and teaching, thereby creating a reputation. However, the proliferation of digital media has made it is possible to know the real opinion of stakeholders on a range of issues, including brand perception. Therefore, analysing datasets from social networks, blogs and the comment sections of websites has become an increasingly worthwhile task to getting a thorough understanding of an organisation's reputation. One way to approach this task is to use natural language processing (NLP) technologies as part of the process of conceiving the social reputation of institutional brands by interpreting a large amount of comments from social users. NLP technologies are useful for identifying and quantifying positive, neutral, negative and other information posted on social networks, i.e., Twitter. Through this research, we intend to monitor the situation of universities in the Valencian Community in terms of audience opinions, based on a justified selection of human language technologies that provide the necessary data from tweets, to create different classifications such as reputation, audience, among others.;1;3;audience | human language technologies | natural language processing | NLP | opinion mining | public opinion | reputation | sentiment analysis | social media | Spain | technologies | universities;2022;Management Information Systems | Business and International Management | Marketing;25;International Journal of Electronic Marketing and Retailing

This study quantified online negative sentiment using micro-blog text mining and a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model (TVP-VAR) to empirically analyze the dynamic impact of negative public emotions on agricultural product prices during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It was found that the online negative sentiment impacted agricultural products prices during COVID-19 and had significant time-varying, lag, and life cycle characteristics, with the responses being most significant in the spread and recession periods. Differences were found in the price responses for different agricultural products and in different risk areas. The online negative sentiment was found to have the greatest impact on vegetable prices, with livestock products and vegetable prices being mainly positively impacted, fruit prices being mainly negatively impacted, and aquatic product prices being negatively impacted in the early stage and positively impacted in the middle and late stages. The online negative sentiment had the greatest impact on medium-risk area agricultural product prices, followed by low-risk areas, with the lowest impact found on the high-risk area agricultural product prices.

184;58413488500;Tang H.;Tang;Sichuan Agricultural University;Ya'an;China;Dynamic impact of negative public sentiment on agricultural product prices during COVID-19;Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services;The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significantly negative impact on public sentiment, which has resulted in panic and some irrational buying behavior, which in turn has had a complex impact on agricultural product prices. This study quantified online negative sentiment using micro-blog text mining and a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model (TVP-VAR) to empirically analyze the dynamic impact of negative public emotions on agricultural product prices during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It was found that the online negative sentiment impacted agricultural products prices during COVID-19 and had significant time-varying, lag, and life cycle characteristics, with the responses being most significant in the spread and recession periods. Differences were found in the price responses for different agricultural products and in different risk areas. The online negative sentiment was found to have the greatest impact on vegetable prices, with livestock products and vegetable prices being mainly positively impacted, fruit prices being mainly negatively impacted, and aquatic product prices being negatively impacted in the early stage and positively impacted in the middle and late stages. The online negative sentiment had the greatest impact on medium-risk area agricultural product prices, followed by low-risk areas, with the lowest impact found on the high-risk area agricultural product prices.

A Case Study of the Jodipan Colorful Urban Village, Malang, Indonesia;Journal of Nonprofit and Public Sector Marketing;This study evaluated the branding of a slum project as a social marketing initiative to transform the Jodipan slum area into a tourism village in the city of Malang. An action–evaluation research project was conducted through the combination of the marketing and planning oriented approaches by the communications department at a major public university in Indonesia between June 2016 and October 2017. The study employed a case study supported by qualitative data from primary and secondary sources, including social media text mining analysis. Moreover, an evaluation survey was conducted using proportionally random sampling from 650 slum dwellers to assess the impacts of the project in terms of the general welfare of the community. The transformation of the slum area into a new tourist destination was found to have been successfully implemented through the combined marketing and planning-oriented community social marketing project. The tourist destination produced was also observed to have a good impact on environmental sustainability and economic value for the local community. Jodipan branding project is unique as observed in its ability to transform an unhealthy settlement into a healthy settlement. Theoretically, it has contributed to new knowledge on slum upgrading in urban studies, especially with the focus on the successful improvement of the physical, social, and economic conditions of the area. This research further contributed to a new understanding and novelty of knowledge on the ability of place branding, as a social marketing strategy, to change the behavior of slum dwellers. However, this research has limitations in exploring the local government’s response to the project, therefore, future studies need to clarify issues relating to local policies and official budgets for its sustainability.;2;5;Jodipan | place branding | Slum area | social marketing | social media | tourism;2022;Marketing;77;Journal of Nonprofit and Public Sector Marketing

Today many individuals change their consumption practices and actively limit their overall consumption due to ethical and environmental concerns. This article focuses on voluntary simplicity, a sustainable lifestyle phenomenon that comprises environment-friendly consumption practices as an innate characteristic. This paper offers a fresh and nuanced understanding of voluntary simplicity through the lens of social cognitive theory (SCT) and by examining textual content generated by voluntary simplifiers on Facebook. Five thousand three hundred thirty-six Facebook posts and comments were scrapped and examined using sentiment analysis, associative networks and cluster analysis. Results further our understanding of this lifestyle in the three interconnected domains of SCT (i.e., personal, behavioural and environmental). Insights obtained from this study can help develop a more complete conceptualization of voluntary simplicity and consumers who consider adopting this lifestyle choice.;3;1;NA;2022;Applied Psychology | Economics and Econometrics | Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health | Marketing;83;International Journal of Consumer Studies

The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1–4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person’s unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human–AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6).

This research classifies social media brand imagery and studies user response. Aside from packshots (standalone product images), two types of brand-related selfie images appear online: consumer selfies (featuring brands and consumers’ faces) and an emerging phenomenon the authors term “brand selfies” (invisible consumers holding a branded product). The authors use convolutional neural networks to identify these archetypes and train language models to infer social media response to more than a quarter-million brand-image posts (185 brands on Twitter and Instagram). They find that consumer-selfie images receive more sender engagement (i.e., likes and comments), whereas brand selfies result in more brand engagement, expressed by purchase intentions. These results cast doubt on whether conventional social media metrics are appropriate indicators of brand engagement. Results for display ads are consistent with this observation, with higher click-through rates for brand selfies than for consumer selfies. A controlled lab experiment suggests that self-reference is driving the differential response to selfie images. Collectively, these results demonstrate how (interpretable) machine learning helps extract marketing-relevant information from unstructured multimedia content and that selfie images are a matter of perspective in terms of actual brand engagement.;27;4;deep learning | image analysis | interpretable machine learning | natural language processing | social media | user-generated content;2021;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;66;Journal of Marketing Research

First, a field data set of over 200,000 text and images posts by brands across two major platforms is analyzed. Using recent automated text analysis (Study 1a) and computer vision methods (Studies 1b and 1c), the author provides initial documentation of a negative relationship between brand emotionality and status. Exploring this relationship further, in Studies 2, 3, and 4, the author finds that brands can leverage this association, reducing emotionality in brand communications to increase perceived brand status. This strategy is effective because reduced emotionality is associated with high-status communication norms, which evoke high-status reference groups. This finding is moderated by the status context of the brand (Study 2) and the product type (Study 4).;10;1;computer vision | emotional expression | reference groups | social media | status | text analysis;2021;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;104;Journal of Marketing Research

In this research, the authors propose that consumer goals can be detected through textual analysis of online search queries and that both marketers and consumers can benefit when paid search results and advertisements match consumer search–related goals. In bridging construal level theory and textual analysis, the authors show that consumers at different stages of the decision journey tend to assume different levels of mental construal, or mindsets (i.e., abstract vs. concrete). They find evidence of a fluency-driven matching effect in online search such that when consumer mindsets are more abstract (more concrete), consumers generate textual search queries that use more abstract (more concrete) language. Furthermore, they are more likely to click on search engine results and ad content that matches their mindset, thereby experiencing more search satisfaction and perceiving greater goal progress. Six empirical studies, including a pilot study, a survey, three lab experiments, and a field experiment involving over 128,000 ad impressions provide support for this construal matching effect in online search.;28;3;abstract vs. concrete mindsets | construal level | consumer decision journey | goal progress | online search | processing fluency | search queries;2021;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;54;Journal of Marketing Research

Furthermore, they are more likely to click on search engine results and ad content that matches their mindset, thereby experiencing more search satisfaction and perceiving greater goal progress. Six empirical studies, including a pilot study, a survey, three lab experiments, and a field experiment involving over 128,000 ad impressions provide support for this construal matching effect in online search.;28;3;abstract vs. concrete mindsets | construal level | consumer decision journey | goal progress | online search | processing fluency | search queries;2021;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;54;Journal of Marketing Research

Drawing on data from over 11,000 participants across ten experiments, the authors offer evidence that when news is repeatedly retold, it undergoes a stylistic transformation termed “disagreeable personalization,” wherein original facts are increasingly supplanted by opinions and interpretations with a slant toward negativity. The central thesis is that when retellers believe they are more (vs. less) knowledgeable than their recipient about the information they are relaying, they feel more compelled to provide guidance on its meaning and to do so in a persuasive manner. This enhanced motivation to guide persuasively, in turn, leads retellers to not only select the subset of facts they deem most essential but, critically, to provide their interpretations and opinions on those facts, with negativity being used as a means of grabbing their audience’s attention.

This article explores trust and privacy issues relating to social media while evaluating current public opinion regarding political advertising on Facebook, which unlike Twitter and Google, has remained steadfast in its support for political advertising. The study uses a textual analysis of Twitter data collected from conversations in October 2019 to provide a snapshot of public rhetoric at this point in time. Results from the text analysis identify trends around the upcoming election, political advertising, Russia and Trump. Topics are further investigated using an online survey panel of 300 participants. ANOVA results indicate that privacy concerns are a key driver of desire to remove political advertising. The results suggest that user perception of Facebook advertising is decreasing as a result of privacy concerns related to trust in the platform. Political advertisers should therefore reevaluate their communication strategy with regard to Facebook advertising.;5;3;Facebook | Misinformation | Online advertising | Online trust | Political advertising | Privacy | Public opinion;2021;Communication | Marketing;52;Journal of Digital and Social Media Marketing

196;57221647396;Gross T.W.;Gross;Founder;NA;Israel;Thesis and antithesis — innovation and predictive analytics: ∑ (past + present) data ≠ future success;Applied Marketing Analytics;Predictive analytics (PA) is a tool routinely used by companies to help chart a future product path. It makes extensive use of algorithms and data mining to sort out market desires and trends. It also combines a robust host of artificial intelligence tools, including machine learning, pattern recognition, natural language processing, sentiment analysis and emotion recognition, among others, to achieve more precise results. PA, though, is imperfect, as it is often subject to the whims of the marketplace. Analysing past and present data does not, in any manner, guarantee positive results. Indeed, when it comes to innovation, particularly ‘disruptive innovation’, relying on PA can lead a company down a disastrous path. Data analytics requires a method that validates innovation and uses PA as something other than an infallible crystal ball. But does the possibility of innovation automatically disavow any insights into future market trends that PA may supply? This paper attempts to place both innovation and PA into proper perspective. It considers when, where, how and why PA and innovation are paramount, but reiterates the importance of instinct, originality and creativity. To illustrate its argument, the paper draws on the history of the Sony Walkman and Apple iPod.;1;1;Artificial intelligence (AI) | Data analytics | Disruption | Disruptive innovation | Innovation | Market analytics | Predictive analytics;2021;Strategy and Management | Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty | Marketing;45;Applied Marketing Analytics
197;57217120072;Ahmad F.;Ahmad;University of North Texas;Denton;United States;Negative online reviews, brand equity and emotional contagion;European Journal of Marketing;Purpose: Despite the growing consensus that consumers extensively use online reviews and that negative reviews can significantly damage brand equity, it remains uncertain whether negative online reviews that focus on different aspects of a service have a similar or differential effect on brand equity. This study aims to fill this gap and explores the mediating role of emotional contagion and what kind of response helps better deter their negative effect. Design/methodology/approach: This research is conducted through a one-panel study and three experimental studies. SAS enterprise miner is used for text mining analysis and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Process macro models are used to analyze the experimental data. Findings: Negative reviews related to the tangibility, responsiveness and empathy dimensions have a more detrimental effect on brand equity than negative reviews related to the assurance and reliability dimensions. The results also provide evidence that emotional contagion is more prevalent when consumers read reviews that are specific to the empathy and responsiveness dimensions. Finally, accommodative responses from the service provider are more effective in deterring the effect of a negative online review on brand equity. Research limitations/implications: The generalizability of this study is limited to the restaurant and hotel industry. Practical implications: The findings will also help the brand manager in understanding the comparative effect of service quality-specific negative reviews on brand equity and also the type of responses that brand managers should give to negative reviews. Originality/value: Despite online reviews receiving increased attention in academic research, Service quality (SERVQUAL) dimension-specific reviews have not been studied until now. This study contributes to the service quality-related literature by providing evidence that not all negative online reviews related to different Service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions equally affect brand equity.;8;2;Accommodative and defensive response | Brand equity | Data analysis | Emotional contagion | Online reviews | Service quality | SERVQUAL;2021;Marketing;124;European Journal of Marketing

But the unstructured, high-dimensional, and dynamic nature of such data makes extracting valuable insights challenging. Here we propose a model that combines the simplicity of matrix factorization with the flexibility of neural networks to efficiently extract nonlinear patterns from massive text data collections relevant to con-sumers’ online consumption patterns. Our model decomposes a user’s content consumption journey into nonlinear user and content factors that are used to model their dynamic interests. This natural decomposition allows us to summarize each user’s content consumption journey with a dynamic probabilistic weighting over a set of underlying content attributes. The model is fast to estimate, easy to interpret, and can harness external data sources as an empirical prior. These advantages make our method well suited to the chal-lenges posed by modern data sets used by digital marketers. We use our model to under-stand the dynamic news consumption interests of Boston Globe readers over five years. Thorough qualitative studies, including a crowdsourced evaluation, highlight our model’s ability to accurately identify nuanced and coherent consumption patterns. These results are supported by our model’s superior and robust predictive performance over several competitive baseline methods.;8;2;Deep learning | Digital marketing | Machine learning | Natural language processing | User profiling;2021;Business and International Management | Marketing;56;Marketing Science

However, the diffusion of mobile payments over the years has been less than optimal despite the numerous studies that have explored the reasons for its adoption. Consequently, there is an increased interest in exploring alternative actions for promoting its diffusion, especially user recommendation of the technology. This is because positive recommendations can enormously influence the decisions of potential consumers to use the technology while negative recommendations can increase resistance to it. The few extant studies in this domain have followed the traditional survey approach with hypothetic-deductive reasoning, thus limiting an understanding of factors outside their conceptual models that could influence recommendations. To address this shortcoming, this study uses a qualitative text-mining approach that explores themes from user reviews of mobile payment applications (apps). Using 5955 reviews from 16 mobile payment apps hosted on the Google Play store, this study applied the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) text-mining method to extract themes from the reviews that help to explain why users provide positive or negative recommendations about mobile payment systems. A total of 13 themes (i.e. ease of use, usefulness, convenience, security, reliability, satisfaction, transaction speed, time-saving, customer support, output quality, perceived cost, usability and trust) were generated from the LDA model which provides both theoretical and practical insights for advancing mobile payments diffusion and research.;25;2;Mobile payment | Negative recommendation | Positive recommendation | Text-mining;2021;Marketing;65;Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services

The early identification of water-based disasters can be lifesaving, and the challenge is to identify appropriate and timely warning measures. Social-media tools such as Twitter provide citizens with a real-time communication channel for reporting problems related to our environment, which allows humans to act as social sensors. In this article, we show the main results and lessons learned from the research project WATERoT, funded by the Spanish government. In this project, we designed a social sensing application (called WATERSensing) for the prevention and evaluation of water-related disasters with the participation of individuals through social networks. This tool crawls microtexts from different social networks such as Twitter, RSS feeds, or Telegram, which are analyzed with natural language processing techniques.

We present illustrative examples to show how the tool can be used for such diverse purposes as (1) uncovering the distinctive vocabularies that consumers use when writing reviews on smartphones versus PCs, (2) discovering how the words used in Tweets differ between presumed supporters and opponents of a controversial ad, and (3) expanding the dictionaries of dictionary-based sentiment-measurement tools. We show empirically that Wordify's RLR algorithm performs better at discriminating vocabularies than support vector machines and chisquare selectors, while offering significant advantages in computing time.

207;57196053122;Puranam D.;Puranam;USC Marshall School of Business;Los Angeles;United States;The impact of increase in minimum wages on consumer perceptions of service: a transformer model of online restaurant reviews;Marketing Science;We study the impact of a mandated increase in minimum wages on consumer perceptions of multiple dimensions of service quality in the restaurant industry. When faced with higher minimum wages, firms might reduce the number of employees, resulting in poorer consumer service. Alternatively, higher-paid workers might be more motivated to improve consumer service. Using a combination of human annotation and several transformer models, we estimate the incidence of discussion of several service quality attributes (and their valence) in a textual data set of 97,242 online reviews of 1,752 restaurants posted over two years. We exploit a natural experiment in the County of Santa Clara, California, wherein only the city of San Jose legislated a 25% minimum wage increase in 2013. By comparing restaurant reviews in San Jose with those of synthetic controls, we find an improvement in the perceived service quality of San Jose restaurants. Specifically, we find reduced negative discussion of the courtesy and friendliness of workers. This decrease is present in independent restaurants and not in chains. This finding appears to be consistent with agency theory–based predictions of greater incentives to improve service in independent restaurants. We discuss alternative mechanisms for our results. We also discuss implications for consumers, restaurants, and policy makers.;2;3;Agency theory | Minimum wages | Natural experiments | Service quality | Text analysis | Transformer models;2021;Business and International Management | Marketing;61;Marketing Science

208;6701404381;Jedidi K.;Jedidi;NA;NA;NA;R2M Index 1.0: Assessing the Practical Relevance of Academic Marketing Articles;Journal of Marketing;Using text-mining, the authors develop version 1.0 of the Relevance to Marketing (R2M) Index, a dynamic index that measures the topical and timely relevance of academic marketing articles to marketing practice. The index assesses topical relevance drawing on a dictionary of marketing terms derived from 50,000 marketing articles published in practitioner outlets from 1982 to 2019. Timely relevance is based on the prevalence of academic marketing topics in practitioner publications at a given time. The authors classify topics into four quadrants based on their low/high popularity in academia and practice —“Desert,” “Academic Island,” “Executive Fields,” and “Highlands”—and score academic articles and journals: Journal of Marketing has the highest R2M score, followed by Marketing Science, Journal of Marketing Research, and Journal of Consumer Research. The index correlates with practitioner judgments of practical relevance and other relevance measures.

The index assesses topical relevance drawing on a dictionary of marketing terms derived from 50,000 marketing articles published in practitioner outlets from 1982 to 2019. Timely relevance is based on the prevalence of academic marketing topics in practitioner publications at a given time. The authors classify topics into four quadrants based on their low/high popularity in academia and practice —“Desert,” “Academic Island,” “Executive Fields,” and “Highlands”—and score academic articles and journals: Journal of Marketing has the highest R2M score, followed by Marketing Science, Journal of Marketing Research, and Journal of Consumer Research. The index correlates with practitioner judgments of practical relevance and other relevance measures.

Just as firms market their products with packaging and advertising, scholars market their ideas with writing. Even the best ideas will make an impact only if others understand and build on them. Why, then, is academic writing often difficult to understand? In two experiments and a text analysis of 1,640 articles in premier marketing journals, this research shows that scholars write unclearly in part because they forget that they know more about their research than readers, a phenomenon called “the curse of knowledge.” Knowledge, or familiarity with one’s own research, exacerbates three practices that make academic writing difficult to understand: abstraction, technical language, and passive writing. When marketing scholars know more about a research project, they use more abstract, technical, and passive writing to describe it. Articles with more abstract, technical, and passive writing are harder for readers to understand and are less likely to be cited. The authors call for scholars to overcome the curse of knowledge and provide two tools—a website (writingclaritycalculator.com) and a tutorial—to help them recognize and repair unclear writing so they can write articles that are more likely to make an impact.;19;4;citations | methods | readability | relevance | text analysis | writing;2021;Business and International Management | Marketing;71;Journal of Marketing

Customer experience plays an important role as an antecedent to brand engagement, brand adoption, and eventual brand loyalty. Thus, it is important for businesses to understand their customers’ experiences so that they can make changes as necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented changes to the business landscape, forcing businesses to move online, with many utilizing enterprise video conferencing (EVC) to maintain daily operations. To ensure efficient digitization, many turned to the online reviews of others’ experiences with EVC before engaging with it themselves. This research examined how the customer experience is portrayed through emotional tone and word choice in online reviews for the EVC platform Zoom. Using computerized text analysis, key differences were found in the emotional tone and word choice for low- and high-rated reviews. The complexity and emotionality expressed in reviews have implications on the usability of the review for others. The results from this study suggest that online customer reviews with a high rating express a higher level of expertise and confidence than low-rated reviews. Given the potential dissemination and impact, digital marketers may be well advised to first and foremost respond to online reviews that are high in emotional tone.;11;3;artificial intelligence | computerized text analysis | customer experience | disruptive technology | enterprise video conferencing | online reviews | Zoom;2021;Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;127;Australasian Marketing Journal

213;22833662100;Berger J.;Berger;University of Pennsylvania;Philadelphia;United States;What Makes Content Engaging? How Emotional Dynamics Shape Success;Journal of Consumer Research;Some cultural products (e.g., books and movies) catch on and become popular, while others fail. Why? While some have argued that success is unpredictable, we suggest that period-to-period shifts in sentiment - what we term sentiment volatility - enhance engagement. Automated sentiment analysis of over 4,000 movies demonstrates that more volatile movies are evaluated more positively. Consistent with the notion that sentiment volatility makes experiences more stimulating, the effect is stronger in genres where evaluations are more likely to be driven stimulation (i.e., thrillers rather than romance). Further, analysis of over 30,000 online articles demonstrate that people are more likely to continue reading more volatile articles.

How Emotional Dynamics Shape Success;Journal of Consumer Research;Some cultural products (e.g., books and movies) catch on and become popular, while others fail. Why? While some have argued that success is unpredictable, we suggest that period-to-period shifts in sentiment - what we term sentiment volatility - enhance engagement. Automated sentiment analysis of over 4,000 movies demonstrates that more volatile movies are evaluated more positively. Consistent with the notion that sentiment volatility makes experiences more stimulating, the effect is stronger in genres where evaluations are more likely to be driven stimulation (i.e., thrillers rather than romance). Further, analysis of over 30,000 online articles demonstrate that people are more likely to continue reading more volatile articles.

215;54385232500;Faraoni M.;Faraoni;Università degli Studi di Firenze;Florence;Italy;Building a sustainable brand image in luxury fashion companies;The Art of Digital Marketing for Fashion and Luxury Brands: Marketspaces and Marketplaces;"Building a sustainable brand image for a luxury fashion company is a very complex and tangled marketing process. Brand image is a set of perceptions and beliefs surrounding a particular brand fixed in the mind of the consumer. It represents the result of the associations that the consumer recognizes in a brand and summarizes the positioning, personality and reputation of the brand itself. Companies can derive fundamental insights by analysing the associations and how they are formed and, in particular, whether they are related to their positioning choices. In the luxury fashion business, brand image communication is often delegated to offline events to convey specific values, ideals and messages to consumers and build brand associations. The Salvatore Ferragamo Museum, in particular, with its ""Sustainable Thinking"" exhibition, is seen as the emblem of this vision, the goal of which is to deliver a specific concept of a sustainable brand image to its customers. The objective of this empirical research was to seek correspondences or discrepancies between consumer brand perceptions and the identity conveyed by the Ferragamo brand in terms of sustainability. By using a netnographic and text mining methodology we found that the consumer associates the brand with a company committed to the environment and involved in social issues; a company that traditionally shows creative and experimental skills, using unusual materials, artisanry, innovative techniques and unique designs. The image that the company wants to convey, however, also includes other characterizations. Specifically, the company considers the ""Made in Italy"" aspect, the importance of its history and its family identity as decisive associations. These are all elements that, as far as this survey is concerned, were not found in the consumer perspective. As a result, from the comparison between the brand associations of both subjects, gaps emerge on which the company must intervene by designing new communication strategies or correcting existing ones in order to improve brand image and the overall brand value in terms of sustainability.";1;1;Brand identity | Brand image | Luxury brands | Netnography | Sustainability | Text-mining;2021;Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all) | Business, Management and Accounting (all);74;The Art of Digital Marketing for Fashion and Luxury Brands: Marketspaces and Marketplaces

221;56584088900;Woolley K.;Woolley;NA;NA;NA;Incentives Increase Relative Positivity of Review Content and Enjoyment of Review Writing;Journal of Marketing Research;A series of controlled experiments examine how the strategy of incentivizing reviews influences consumers’ expressions of positivity. Incentivized (vs. unincentivized) reviews contained a greater proportion of positive relative to negative emotion across a variety of product and service experiences (e.g., videos, service providers, consumer packaged goods companies). This effect occurred for both financial and nonfinancial incentives and when assessing review content across multiple natural language processing tools and human judgments. Incentives influence review content by modifying the experience of writing reviews. That is, when incentives are associated with review writing, they cause the positive affect that results from receiving an incentive to transfer to the review-writing experience, making review writing more enjoyable. In line with this process, the effect of an incentive on review positivity attenuates when incentives are weakly (vs. strongly) associated with review writing (i.e., incentive for “participating in an experiment” vs. “writing a review”) and when the incentive does not transfer positive affect (i.e., when an incentive is provided by a disliked company). By examining when incentives do (vs. do not) adjust the relative positivity of written reviews, this research offers theoretical insight into the literature on incentives, motivation, and word of mouth, with practical implications for managers.;15;2;enjoyment | incentives | motivation | natural language processing | reviews | word of mouth;2021;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;81;Journal of Marketing Research

In a live stream, viewers may send virtual gifts (tips) to the broadcaster and engage with likes and chats free of charge. These activities reflect viewers’ underlying emotion and are likely to be affected by the broadcaster’s emotion. This article examines the role of emotion in interactive and dynamic business settings such as live streaming. To account for the possibility that broadcaster emotion, viewer emotion, and viewer activities influence each other, the authors estimate a panel vector autoregression model on data at the minute level from 1,450 live streams. The results suggest that a happier broadcaster makes the audience happier and begets intensified viewer activities, in particular tips. In addition, broadcasters reciprocate viewer engagement with more smiles. Further analyses suggest that these effects are pronounced only after a live stream has been active for a while, and they manifest only in streams by broadcasters who have more experience, receive more tips, or are more popular in past live streams. These results help platforms and broadcasters optimize marketing interventions such as broadcaster emotion enhancement in live streaming and quantify the financial returns.;67;3;digital marketing | emotion | engagement | live streaming | social media | text analysis | video analysis;2021;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;64;Journal of Marketing Research

The results suggest that a happier broadcaster makes the audience happier and begets intensified viewer activities, in particular tips. In addition, broadcasters reciprocate viewer engagement with more smiles. Further analyses suggest that these effects are pronounced only after a live stream has been active for a while, and they manifest only in streams by broadcasters who have more experience, receive more tips, or are more popular in past live streams. These results help platforms and broadcasters optimize marketing interventions such as broadcaster emotion enhancement in live streaming and quantify the financial returns.;67;3;digital marketing | emotion | engagement | live streaming | social media | text analysis | video analysis;2021;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;64;Journal of Marketing Research

This research identifies factors that can separate deceptive reviews from genuine ones. First, we create a novel means of detection by contrasting authentic versus fake word patterns specific to a given domain (e.g., hotel services). We use a survey on a crowdsourcing platform to obtain both genuine and deceptive reviews of hotels. We learned the word patterns from each category to discriminate genuine reviews from fake ones for positively and negatively evaluated reviews, respectively. We show that our All Terms procedure outperforms current benchmark methods in computational linguistics and marketing. Our extended analysis reveals the factors that determine fake reviews (e.g., a lack of details, present- and future-time orientation, and emotional exaggeration) and the factors influencing people's willingness to write fake reviews (including social media trust, product quality consciousness, deal proneness, hedonic and utilitarian consumption, prosocial behavior, and individualism). We also use our procedure to analyze more than 250,000 real-world hotel reviews to detect fake reviews and identify the hotel and review characteristics influencing review fakery in the industry (e.g., star rating, franchise hotel, hotel size, room price, review timing, and review rating).;26;3;Fake review | Hotel | LIWC | Online consumer review | Survey | Text mining;2021;Marketing;98;International Journal of Research in Marketing

By applying the theory of customer value, this study explores the benefits and costs of two levels of mass customization (MC) to identify the values derived from style (i.e. shoe customization) and fit customization experiences (i.e. apparel customization) and further to compare the dominating dimensions of value derived across style and fit customization. Design/methodology/approach: A WCM approach was applied. Also, two case studies were conducted with one focusing on style customization and the other focusing on fit customization. The brand Vans was selected to examine style customization in study 1. The brand Sumissura was selected to examine fit customization in study 2. Consumers' comments on customization experiences from these two brands were collected through social networks, respectively. After data cleaning, 394 reviews for Vans and 510 reviews for Sumissura were included in the final data analysis. Co-occurrence plots, feature extraction and grouping were used for the data analysis. Findings: The emotional value was found to be the major benefit for style customization, while the functional value was indicated as the major benefit for fit customization, followed by ease of use and emotional value. In addition, three major themes of costs, including unsatisfied service, disappointing product performance and financial risk, were revealed by excavating and evaluating consumers' feedback of their actual clothing customization experiences with Sumissura. Originality/value: This study initiates the effort to use web mining, specifically, the WCM approach to thoroughly investigate the benefits and costs of MC through real consumers' feedback of two different types of fashion products. The analysis of this study also reflects the levels of customization: style and fit. It provides an in-depth text analysis of online MC consumers' feedback through the use of feature extraction analysis and word co-occurrence networks.;10;3;Fit customization | Mass customization | Real experiences | Style customization | The theory of customer value | Web content mining;2021;Business and International Management | Marketing;58;Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management

Beset with formidable competition, sporting goods stores are compelled to augment their merchandise with service and improve retail quality. The purpose of this study is to investigate retail quality of sporting goods stores (RQSGS). Design/methodology/approach: Based on 27,793 online reviews of 1481 stores in the United States, this study used Leximancer 4.0, a text mining software, to identify critical retail quality dimensions associated with sporting goods stores, and further explored the most salient dimensions among different levels of ratings. Findings: Customer service and store aspects are the two higher-order dimensions of RQSGS; holistic experience, manager and staff are three themes under customer service, and product, B&M store and online–offline integration are three themes under store aspects. Furthermore, extreme reviews focus more on customer service, whereas lukewarm reviews focus more on store aspects. Practical implications: Knowledgeable staff, managers and online–offline integration are instrumental in creating superior retail quality. Sporting goods stores should enhance hedonic and social values for consumers in order to ward off online competitions. Originality/value: This study explored retail quality dimensions that are pertinent to sporting goods retailing utilizing text mining methods. This study to certain extent cross-validated the existing retailing literature that is developed on alternative methods.";7;1;e-Commerce | Leximancer | Retail quality | Sporting goods stores | Text mining;2021;Business and International Management | Finance | Marketing;84;International Journal of Sports Marketing and Sponsorship

In particular, brand-owned social media seems to be an increasingly popular way of enhancing a brand’s position, connecting with customers, and improving customer engagement with the brand. To guide strategic marketing communication decision-making on social media, the current study extends the relationship communication model and offers an analytical workflow to gain new insights from unstructured textual data available on brand-owned social media. The workflow utilizes an eclectic mix of analytical tools such as word clouds, and cluster and word association analyses, which collectively allow for identification of main topics and their temporal evolution in unstructured textual data from a brand’s social media. In doing so, the proposed workflow offers researchers and practitioners a step by step procedure to make sense of such textual data, which may prove unwieldy and overwhelming otherwise. Furthermore, to manifest the utility of the proposed workflow, it is applied to illustrative data collected from a brand’s Facebook page. Results from this example analysis point to a slight fading of the brand’s perceived core position as an event avenue, as well as an evolution of customer sentiments that may reflect different levels and types of customer engagement with the page.

Can analytics uncover the linguistic “plot arcs” and resulting sentiment or emotion in political text? This paper examines how natural language processing (NLP) and data visualization tools and methods in analytics can play a key role in marketing political candidates. Using publicly available text messages, the authors employ NLP techniques to transform the text observations from the past campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump into a linguistic “corpus” and story arc visualizations. The methodology includes the use of Syuzhet and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models. The resulting data visualizations reveal the story arcs associated with the candidate’s communications, and they provide a means to analyze the unbiased political sentiment or hidden emotion in the text. In an analysis of the results, the authors found distinctly different story arcs and vocabulary usage among the three Presidential candidates. The contribution to the literature is a methodology for extracting the story and the resulting sentiment from text messages for marketing campaigns. The authors suggest that the techniques used in this paper can assist future research on marketing other products or services that utilize computer-mediated communications.;5;2;Analytics | Natural language processing | Political marketing | Text mining | Visualization story arcs;2021;Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous) | Strategy and Management | Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty | Marketing;35;Journal of Marketing Analytics

But could a simple shift in language help improve customer satisfaction? We suggest that linguistic concreteness-the tangibility, specificity, or imaginability of words employees use when speaking to customers-can shape consumer attitudes and behaviors. Five studies, including text analysis of over 1,000 real consumer-employee interactions in two different field contexts, demonstrate that customers are more satisfied, willing to purchase, and purchase more when employees speak to them concretely. This occurs because customers infer that employees who use more concrete language are listening (i.e., attending to and understanding their needs). These findings deepen understanding of how language shapes consumer behavior, reveal a psychological mechanism by which concreteness impacts person perception, and provide a straightforward way that managers could help enhance customer satisfaction.;39;2;concreteness | customer service | language | listening | social perception;2021;Business and International Management | Anthropology | Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous) | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;106;Journal of Consumer Research

The main hypothesis is that greater expertise in generating reviews leads to greater restraint from extreme summary evaluations. The authors argue that greater experience generating reviews facilitates processing and elaboration and enhances the number of attributes implicitly considered in evaluations, which reduces the likelihood of assigning extreme summary ratings. This restraint-of-expertise hypothesis is tested across different review platforms (TripAdvisor, Qunar, and Yelp), shown for both assigned ratings and review text sentiment, and demonstrated both between (experts vs. novices) and within reviewers (expert vs. pre-expert). Two experiments replicate the main effect and provide support for the attribute-based explanation. Field studies demonstrate two major consequences of the restraint-of-expertise effect. (i) Reviewing experts (vs. novices), as a whole, have less impact on the aggregate valence metric, which is known to affect page-rank and consumer consideration. (ii) Experts systematically benefit and harm service providers with their ratings. For service providers that generally provide mediocre (excellent) experiences, reviewing experts assign significantly higher (lower) ratings than novices. This research provides important caveats to the existing marketing practice of service providers incentivizing reviewing experts and provides strategic implications for how platforms should adopt rating scales and aggregate ratings.;7;4;expertise | online word-of-mouth | platform strategy | sentiment analysis | text analysis | user rating average;2021;Business and International Management | Anthropology | Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous) | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;64;Journal of Consumer Research

(ii) Experts systematically benefit and harm service providers with their ratings. For service providers that generally provide mediocre (excellent) experiences, reviewing experts assign significantly higher (lower) ratings than novices. This research provides important caveats to the existing marketing practice of service providers incentivizing reviewing experts and provides strategic implications for how platforms should adopt rating scales and aggregate ratings.;7;4;expertise | online word-of-mouth | platform strategy | sentiment analysis | text analysis | user rating average;2021;Business and International Management | Anthropology | Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous) | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;64;Journal of Consumer Research
230;7005607623;Cotte J.;Cotte;Ivey Business School;London;Canada;Reviewing Experts' Restraint from Extremes and Its Impact on Service Providers;Journal of Consumer Research;This research investigates reviewing experts on online review platforms. The main hypothesis is that greater expertise in generating reviews leads to greater restraint from extreme summary evaluations. The authors argue that greater experience generating reviews facilitates processing and elaboration and enhances the number of attributes implicitly considered in evaluations, which reduces the likelihood of assigning extreme summary ratings. This restraint-of-expertise hypothesis is tested across different review platforms (TripAdvisor, Qunar, and Yelp), shown for both assigned ratings and review text sentiment, and demonstrated both between (experts vs. novices) and within reviewers (expert vs. pre-expert). Two experiments replicate the main effect and provide support for the attribute-based explanation. Field studies demonstrate two major consequences of the restraint-of-expertise effect. (i) Reviewing experts (vs. novices), as a whole, have less impact on the aggregate valence metric, which is known to affect page-rank and consumer consideration.

How can managers write social media messages that engage consumers? The present research sheds light on how the language of brand messages influences consumer engagement. Text analyses of brand messages posted on Facebook and Twitter shows that brand messages that include words that express certainty (e.g., always, everything, forever) are associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (e.g., likes, comments, shares/retweets). The results of two controlled experiments demonstrate that messages expressing certainty increase engagement by influencing how consumers perceive brands. Specifically, expressing certainty makes brands seem more powerful, and perceptions of power exert a positive effect on engagement. In addition, the indirect effect of certainty on consumer engagement is stronger (weaker) among consumers with higher (lower) power distance beliefs. These results assist marketing managers by demonstrating how language influences consumer engagement on social media.;33;3;NA;2021;Business and International Management | Marketing;73;Journal of Interactive Marketing

In this paper, the researchers demonstrated an approach for destination marketing organisations to explore online tourist-generated content and understand tourists' perceptions of the destination image (DI). Specifically, the researchers initiated an investigation examining how the destination image of Macau changed during the period of 2014–2018 based on user-generated content on travel websites. Design/methodology/approach: Web crawlers developed by Python were employed to collect tourists' reviews from both Ctrip and TripAdvisor regarding the theme of “Macau attraction”. A total of 51,191 reviews (41,352 from Ctrip and 9,839 from TripAdvisor) were collected and analysed using the text-mining technique. Findings: The results reveal that the frequency of casino-related words decreased in reviews by both international and mainland Chinese tourists. Additionally, international and mainland Chinese tourists perceive the DI of Macau differently. Mainland Chinese tourists are more sensitive to new attractions, while international tourists are not. The study also shows that there are differences between the government-projected DI and the tourist-perceived DI. Only the “City of Culture” and “A World Centre of Tourism and Leisure” have built recognition with tourists. Originality/value: Given the easy accessibility of online information from various sources, it is important for destination marketing organisations to analyse and monitor different DI perspectives and adjust their branding strategies for greater effectiveness. This study uncovered the online DI of Macau by using text mining and content analysis of two of the largest travel websites. By analysing and comparing the differences and relationships among the frequently used words of tourist-generated content on these websites, the researchers revealed some interesting findings with important marketing implications.;26;4;Destination image | Online reviews | Text mining | Tourist-generated content;2021;Business and International Management | Strategy and Management | Marketing;78;Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics

An Application of Text Mining Analysis;Asia Marketing Journal;Consumer-generated reviews reflect consumers' experiences and perceptions toward a product or service. In this context, we propose a text mining approach to identify factors that improve customer satisfaction in the mobile banking app service. To do so, we collect 96,140 mobile app reviews for four U.S. banks: Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, and Wells Fargo. Using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model, we first derive the critical quality dimensions such as ease of use, convenience, security, and customer support. Analysis of weekly panel data shows that positive responses to the security and convenience of mobile banking apps improve app ratings. However, increased comments about insecurity, negative customer support experiences, discomfort, and complexity lower user ratings. Overall, the empirical results support that security is the most influential factor in customer satisfaction with mobile financial services.;7;2;Customer reviews | Customer satisfaction | Financial services | Mobile banking application | Text mining;2021;Marketing;35;Asia Marketing Journal

However, the study of sustainable consumption behavior in the online education industry (SCBOEI) remains a research gap. Thus, this paper aims to identify the significance of sustainable consumption behavior and theoretically conceptualize SCBOEI. This study employs content and text analysis to reconceptualize the major theories that contribute to the research of SCB. The findings in this study show that SCBOEI is contributed of great significance to promote sustainable development. In addition, this study introduces a model of SCBOEI, in which the consumer value theory, social exchange theory, and planned behavior theory are integrated. Additionally, this paper suggests that value, environmental attitude, identity, consumer engagement, and contextual factors (government behavior, market conditions, and environmental education) are highly important to extend the research on SCBOEI. In conclusion, this study strongly recommends that SCB research shall be directed to the online education industry. Furthermore, future studies shall emphasize the empirical effects of psychological factors, activity factors, and contextual factors for SCBOEI to find the correlation.;4;2;Chongqing | Consumer | Environmental education | Identify | SCBOEI | Value;2021;Communication | Social Sciences (miscellaneous) | Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous) | Marketing | Management of Technology and Innovation;90;Innovative Marketing

245;50263219900;Vollero A.;Vollero;Università degli Studi di Salerno;Salerno;Italy;Exploring the role of the Amazon effect on customer expectations: An analysis of user-generated content in consumer electronics retailing;Journal of Consumer Behaviour;While Amazon's disruption of the retail market has been associated with significant changes in consumer behavior, empirical studies on how interacting with Amazon has changed customers' expectations toward other offline/online retailers remain scarce. Such Amazon-driven perceptions of service attributes are sometimes referred to as the ‘Amazon effect’. After clarifying the meaning of the Amazon effect and reviewing the studies on consumer complaints online, this paper aims to identify key triggers for the Amazon effect from consumer comments on social media. Based on natural language processing techniques, a content and sentiment analysis of users' comments drawn from the Facebook pages of three leading consumer electronics retailers in Italy over a two-year span (2016–2018) was used to evaluate the dissatisfaction toward these retailers associated to Amazon-related service attributes. The findings show that there is a wide diffusion of consumer comments and service complaints related to the Amazon effect on consumer electronics retailers, especially regarding price, customer service, in-store staff, and post-purchase support. Compared with corresponding evaluations on the Italian Amazon website, the negative sentiments revealed in consumers' comments on Facebook suggest that the Amazon's service standards have raised consumer expectations and have made consumers less satisfied when they interact with other retailers. We argue the need for further research to better clarify Amazonification in terms of customer impatience and dissatisfaction in general, also going beyond price and logistics issues, which are usually considered as the main constitutive factors.;11;3;NA;2021;Social Psychology | Applied Psychology;84;Journal of Consumer Behaviour

247;9432630700;Muñoz-Leiva F.;Muñoz-Leiva;Universidad de Granada;Granada;Spain;Past, present, and future research on self-service merchandising: a co-word and text mining approach;European Journal of Marketing;Purpose: This study aims to discern emerging trends and provide a longitudinal perspective on merchandising research by identifying relationships between merchandising-related subdomains/themes. Design/methodology/approach: This study sourced 657 merchandising-related articles published since 1960, from the Scopus database and 425 from Web of Science. After processing and normalizing the data, this study performed co-word and thematic network analyses. Taking a text mining approach, this study used topic modeling to identify a set of coherent topics characterized by the keywords of the articles. Findings: This study identified the following merchandising-related themes: branding, retail, consumer, behavior, modeling, textile and clothing industry and visual merchandising. Although visual merchandising was the first type of merchandising to be used in-store, only recently has it become an emerging topic in the academic literature. There has been a further trend over the past decade to understand the adoption of simulation technology, such as computer-aided design, particularly in supply chain management in the clothing industry. These and other findings contribute to the discussion of the merchandising concept, approached from an evolutionary perspective. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions of this study hold implications at the intersection of merchandising, sectors, new technologies, research methodologies and merchandising-practitioner education. Research trends suggest that, in the future, virtual reality and augmented reality using neuroscientific methods will be applied to the e-merchandising context. Practical implications: The different dimensions of merchandising can be used to leverage store managers’ decision-making process toward an integrated store-management strategy. In particular, by adopting loyalty merchandising tactics, the store can generate emotional attachment among consumers, who will perceive its value and services as unique, thanks to merchandising items designed specifically with that aim in mind. The stimulation of unplanned purchases, the strategic location of products and duration of each merchandising activity in the store, the digitalization of merchandising and the application of findings from neuroscience studies are some of the most relevant practical applications. Originality/value: This study provides the first-ever longitudinal review of the state of the art in merchandising research, taking a holistic perspective of this field of knowledge spanning a 60-year period. The work makes a valuable contribution to the development of the marketing discipline.;10;4;Bibliometric analysis | Co-word analysis | Point-of-sale marketing | Scopus | Web of Science;2021;Marketing;121;European Journal of Marketing

253;57188667328;Moriuchi E.;Moriuchi;Saunders College of Business;Rochester;United States;An empirical study on anthropomorphism and engagement with disembodied AIs and consumers' re-use behavior;Psychology and Marketing;"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the human race has gradually become a norm. AI entails technology assemblages such as machine learning, natural language processing, and reasoning. The influence of AI systems has intensified in consumers' daily lives. Many consumers have interacted with the notions of AI through advertisements or having personal experiences. Many consumers are curious about the use of AI. This paper reports three studies conducted to determine whether anthropomorphism (ANTH) and engagement play a role in consumers' intention to re-use a voice assistant (VA; a machine-learning AI). The second study will determine if ANTH and engagement play a role when consumers are using the VAs for different activities (task completion vs. information gathering). In addition, in Study 2, actual re-use behavior was also tested in the model, which encouraged a stronger overall model fit. The results show that in general effort expectation (EE) has a strong positive impact on consumers' usage experience of the VA. However, between the two types of activities, EE has a stronger impact on consumers' usage experience for information-gathering activities, whereas performance expectation has a stronger impact on usage experience when consumers use the VA for task-completion purposes. The third study used internet usage experience as a moderating variable to determine the boundaries of the mediating effects in the study. The results show that the mediators yield results similar to prior studies.";59;1;anthropomorphism | artificial intelligence | engagement | intention to re-use | realism maximization theory;2021;Applied Psychology | Marketing;110;Psychology and Marketing

This study has utilised a novel mixed-method approach based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques for the both the qualitative and quantitative analysis. This study has used user-generated content of Coursera (an e-Learning service) consisting of online reviews from Coursera-100 k-dataset and tweets about Coursera.

Data in the form of online interviews were collected for a sample of 69 CMOs from the World’s Most Influential CMO’s report by Forbes Magazine and analyzed using the automated text analysis software, LIWC, employing the dimensions of Analytic, Clout, Authentic, and Tone. A series of ANOVAs was conducted to determine the impact of gender on these dimensions. Clout and Authentic were significantly impacted by the gender of the CMO. The paper considers two gender communication theories that could potentially explain these differences. The paper concludes by discussing managerial implications, acknowledging the limitations, and identifying avenues for future research.;5;1;Chief Marketing Officer | CMO | Gender | LIWC;2021;Strategy and Management | Marketing;70;Journal of Strategic Marketing

In this way, Facebook provides a powerful communication platform for electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). Hospitals increasingly use Facebook to positively influence the perception of their brand reputation and performance. The present explorative study provides detailed information regarding eWOM behavior of persons on the Facebook page of an Upper Austrian hospital. Data of the hospital’s Facebook page was gathered and analyzed with NodeXL. By using a text analysis, we categorized the hospitals’ posts. Reactions towards the different types of postings were analyzed by counting emojis, the number of shares and comments. Within the study, there was an in-depth evaluation of communication data (313 posts of the hospital, more than 14,000 eWom actions by 3327 women, men and organizations). The study shows how heterogeneous users are in their eWOM behavior and that a variety of topics on the Facebook page stimulates electronic recommendations. One major finding of the study is that a significant part of the eWOM is done by only a few users. According to this, a so-called Intensive WOM Behavior (IWB) can be identified. Users of the IWB-group behave heterogeneously. Most react either with an emoji, a comment or a share. Only a few IWB-users respond with a combination of these eWOM-reactions.

271;35316120900;Hu F.;Hu;Zhejiang Normal University;Jinhua;China;What makes a hotel review helpful? An information requirement perspective;Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management;With the dramatic proliferation of online user-generated content (UGC), research has emerged to gain understanding of what makes a review helpful, and how useful knowledge can be filtered from over-loaded UGC. Hospitality literature has widely examined the characteristics of helpful online reviews for identifying the determinants of helpfulness. In contrast, the influence of embedded opinions in reviews on helpfulness voting has rarely been examined. This study investigated the distribution of 28 identified hotel attributes ranging between helpful and not-helpful categories, in 85,963 hotel reviews. The findings suggest that customer information requirements differ according to hotel class. Some attributes are reported as uniquely helpful for a specific hotel class, such as proximity to a station (3-stars), bed and lobby (4-stars), and experience and drinks (5-stars), whereas other attributes apply to multiple groups, such as walking distance (3–4 stars), English fluency (4–5 stars), and front-desk, street-road, taxi, and value (3–5 stars).;19;1;Hotel | information requirements | review helpfulness | text mining | user-generated content;2020;Management Information Systems | Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management | Marketing;74;Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management

In this research, we develop a changepoint model to capture the underlying shifts in social media content. We extend latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a topic modeling approach, by incorporating multiple latent changepoints through a Dirichlet process hidden Markov model that allows for the prevalence of topics to differ before and after each changepoint without requiring prior knowledge about the number of changepoints. We demonstrate our modeling framework using social media posts from brand crises (Volkswagen’s 2015 emissions testing scandal and Under Armour’s 2018 data breach) and a new product launch (Burger King’s 2016 launch of the Angriest Whopper). We show that our model identifies shifts in the conversation surrounding each of these events and outperforms both static and other dynamic topic models. We demonstrate how the model may be used by marketers to actively monitor conversations around their brands, including distinguishing between changes in the conversation arising from a shift in the contributor base and underlying changes in the topics discussed by contributors.;33;2;Changepoint models | Social media | Text analysis | Topic models;2020;Business and International Management | Marketing;52;Marketing Science

Topic models have been successfully applied to such data, demonstrating that empirical text analysis benefits greatly from a latent variable approach that summarizes high-level interactions among words. We propose a new topic model that allows for serial dependency of topics in text. That is, topics may carry over from word to word in a document, violating the bag-of-words assumption in traditional topic models. In the proposed model, topic carryover is informed by sentence conjunctions and punctuation. Typically, such observed information is eliminated prior to analyzing text data (i.e., preprocessing) because words such as “and” and “but” do not differentiate topics. We find that these elements of grammar contain information relevant to topic changes. We examine the performance of our models using multiple data sets and establish boundary conditions for when our model leads to improved inference about customer evaluations.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a combination of methodologies for gathering data in 52 face-to-face interviews across five countries and the downloaded posts from each of the interviewees' Twitter accounts. The tweets were analysed using structural topic modelling (STM), and then compared to the interview data. This method enabled triangulation between stated use of Twitter and respondent's actual tweets. Findings: The research confirmed that individuals used Twitter as a source of information, ideas, promotion and innovation within their industry. Twitter facilitates building relevant business relationships through the exchange of new, expert and high-quality information within like-minded communities in real time, between companies and with their suppliers, customers and also their peers. Research limitations/implications: As this study covered five countries, further comparative research on the use of Twitter in the B2B context is called for. Further investigation of the formalisation of social media strategies and return on investment for social media marketing efforts is also warranted. Practical implications: This research highlights the business relationship building capacity of Twitter as it enables customer and peer conversations that eventually support the development of product and service innovations. Twitter has the capacity for marketers to inform and engage customers and peers in their networks on wider topics thereby building the brand of the individual users and their companies simultaneously. Originality/value: This study focuses on interactions at the individual level illustrating that Twitter is used for both customer and peer interactions that can lead to the sourcing of ideas, knowledge and ultimately innovation.

278;57191891792;Melumad S.;Melumad;Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania;Philadelphia;United States;Full Disclosure: How Smartphones Enhance Consumer Self-Disclosure;Journal of Marketing;Results from three large-scale field studies and two controlled experiments show that consumers tend to be more self-disclosing when generating content on their smartphone versus personal computer. This tendency is found in a wide range of domains including social media posts, online restaurant reviews, open-ended survey responses, and compliance with requests for personal information in web advertisements. The authors show that this increased willingness to self-disclose on one’s smartphone arises from the psychological effects of two distinguishing properties of the device: (1) feelings of comfort that many associate with their smartphone and (2) a tendency to narrowly focus attention on the disclosure task at hand due to the relative difficulty of generating content on the smaller device. The enhancing effect of smartphones on self-disclosure yields several important marketing implications, including the creation of content that is perceived as more persuasive by outside readers. The authors explore implications for how these findings can be strategically leveraged by managers, including how they may generalize to other emerging technologies.;47;2;natural language processing | self-disclosure | technology | user-generated content;2020;Business and International Management | Marketing;66;Journal of Marketing

280;14064624900;Berni R.;Berni;Università degli Studi di Firenze;Florence;Italy;An integrated approach to estimate brand association matching and strength in virtual settings;Journal of Global Fashion Marketing;This paper proposes an innovative method for estimating brand association matching and strength. It is based on a dual analytical perspective as it compares consumer-perceived with company-defined brand associations, thereby filling a research gap in the offline and online brand studies. In order to build this method, we investigate online communities as authentic interactive environments by combining text-mining with Hybrid Log-Linear models. What emerges is an interdisciplinary method that contributes to extending the use of the user-generated content (UGC) for marketing purposes. Its application is useful for verifying the conditions for customer brand equity and more systematically controlling the adopted brand communications. The analysis also takes into consideration consumers who, after experiencing the virtual setting, have become free-brand tellers and real co-creators of brand meaning. In the study, we focus on online fashion communities as digital platforms where consumer interactions are particularly intensive, and the narratives are rich in brand-related perceptions.;5;3;Brand association | Hybrid Log-Linear models | online community | text -mining | User-Generated Content-UGC;2020;Cultural Studies | Strategy and Management | Marketing | Management of Technology and Innovation;56;Journal of Global Fashion Marketing

284;55430704000;Mishra S.;Mishra;Deakin Business School;Melbourne;Australia;Financial constraints and marketing investment: evidence from text analysis;European Journal of Marketing;Purpose: The purpose of this study to examine the effect of financial constraint on intangible investment because intangible investment provides an overall picture of marketing investment and activity. Intangible investment also plays a significant role in facilitating future sales. Using a new measure of intangible investment (Peters and Taylor, 2017), the authors first establish that intangible investment is positively related with future sales. Then, using a new text-based measure of financial constraint, the authors show that financial constraint has a significant negative effect on future intangible investments after controlling for other factors. Intangible investment has three components. The first is R&D, the second is 30 per cent of selling and general administrative expense (SGA) and the third is other intangibles. The authors find that the negative and significant effect of financial constraint on 30 per cent SGA is stronger. This indicates that financially constrained firms reduce marketing related investments. The authors then considered firm size and found that smaller firms facing financial constraint continue to increase their intangible investments, whereas larger firms reduce their intangible investment. As a robustness test, the authors use advertising expenditure as a measure of promotion related investment and find that financial constraint has a negative effect on advertising spending. The authors then use two traditional measures of financial constraint in their analysis to compare with the new text-based measure. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use ordinary least squares with cluster robust standard error to conduct their empirical analysis. Findings: First the authors establish that intangible investment positively affects future sales. Further the authors find that financial constraint negatively affects intangible investment. Moreover, financial constraint negatively affects the brand capital of intangible investment. Research limitations/implications: The authors did not conduct any industry specific analysis to see how financial constraints affect intangible investment across different industries. Industry specific analysis is important because in some industries/sectors intangibles are clearly more important than in others, so this is an important avenue for future research. It will also be interesting to explore if and how financial constraint has a mediating effect on sales growth via intangible investment and different components of intangibles. Practical implications: This study identifies another important factor that can negatively affect brand capital investment. Originality/value: The authors have used a measure of financial constraint and text mined all the annual reports of US firms for the period of 1994-2016 to compute this measure.;10;2;Brand capital | Financial constraints | Intangible investments | Marketing investments | Text analysis;2020;Marketing;71;European Journal of Marketing

285;57220642171;Hung Y.C.;Hung;Singapore University of Social Sciences;Singapore City;Singapore;Winning box office with the right movie synopsis;European Journal of Marketing;Purpose: Consumers often search for movie information and purchase tickets on the go. A synopsis is often provided by producers and theatres in mobile apps and websites. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, little research has investigated whether the synopsis has an impact on a movie’s box office. This research uses computerized text analysis in examining the influence of linguistic cues of a synopsis on the movie’s financial performance. This paper aims to show that language choice in a synopsis is a significant factor in predicting box office performance. Design/methodology/approach: A total usable sample of 5973 movies was collected using a web crawler. Computerised text analysis using linguistic inquiry and word count was adopted to analyse the movie synopses data. The empirical study comprises two phases. Phase 1 used exploratory factor analysis on 50 per cent of the sample (Sample 1) to establish the dimensionality of psychological processes as reflected in the linguistic expressions. The analysis identified 11 linguistic variables that loaded on four dimensions. The factor structure was replicated on an independent sample (Sample 2) using confirmatory factor analysis. Phase 2 tested the hypotheses using structure equation modelling. Findings: Results show that consistency between movie genres and linguistic cues in a film synopsis promotes movie box office revenue when linguistic cues shown in the synopsis confirm a consumer’s expectancies about a focal movie genre. Conversely, a synopsis reduces the movie box office revenue when the linguistic cues shown disconfirm the genre-based expectancies. These linguistic cues exert similar effects on action and crime films but different effects on comedies and drama films. Research limitations/implications: It is likely that consumer tastes and linguistic styles of film synopses have evolved over time. As a cross-sectional study, such changes were not taken into consideration in the current research. A longitudinal study in the future can reveal the dynamic relationship between film synopses and audience. Practical implications: Managerially, the findings show that a synopsis is an effective communication touch point to position a movie. This research provides concrete guidelines in crafting synopses with the “rights words’ aligned with movie-goers’ expectations within each specific genre. Beyond movie consumption, the research findings can be applied to other entertainment products, such as TV series and books. Originality/value: To our knowledge, this research is the first in studying the linguistic cues in synopses and its relation to box office performance. It addresses this knowledge gap by answering the basic question of whether movie synopses matter. Methodically, the paper marks the first attempt to use the two-step structural equation modelling method on computerised content analysis data.;8;2;Box office performance | Computerised content analysis | Expectancy confirmation | Linguistic cues | LIWC | Movie synopsis | Structure equation modelling;2020;Marketing;57;European Journal of Marketing

286;55956942500;Key T.M.;Key;University of Colorado at Colorado Springs;Colorado Springs;United States;How executives talk: Exploring marketing executive value articulation with computerized text analysis;European Journal of Marketing;"Purpose: This paper aims to explore how chief executive officers (CEOs) and C-suite marketing executives (chief marketing officers [CMOs], chief customer officers [CCOs], chief branding officers [CBOs], etc.) talk about marketing concepts to better understand how marketers can more effectively articulate their value and increase their strategic influence within the firm. Design/methodology/approach: Artificial intelligence-enabled computerized text analysis was used to identify and weight keywords from 266 CEO and C-suite marketing executive interviews. Custom marketing concept dictionaries were used to gauge overall marketing focus. Findings: The analysis revealed opportunities for C-suite marketers to align specific marketing concepts with that of CEOs for increased strategic influence. Comparisons between C-suite marketing roles showed that CMOs are more focused on marketing strategy than specialized C-suite marketing positions, such as CCO and CBO. This points to a potential decrease in strategic impact for marketing executives dependent on the specialization of their position. Research limitations/implications: Using IBM Watson’s black-box artificial intelligence may limit the ability to replicate results from the content analysis; however, the results identify important ways that marketing executives can use to increase their ability to articulate their value within the firm. Practical implications: C-suite marketing executives who want to increase the strategic alignment of their role with their firm must pay close attention to the marketing concepts they talk about, and how those align with their CEO’s marketing knowledge. The creation of specialized C-suite marketing roles may unintentionally limit the strategic thinking and firm-level impact of marketers. Originality/value: This paper represents the first use of artificial intelligence-enabled computerized text analysis to explore and compare executive speech acts to help increase marketing’s influence in the firm. It is also the first to explore differences in marketing concept use between C-suite marketing roles.";6;2;Artificial intelligence | Computerized text analysis | Marketing influence | Strategic marketing | Strategic planning;2020;Marketing;53;European Journal of Marketing

287;7101962114;Tsao H.Y.;Tsao;National Chung Hsing University;Taichung;Taiwan;A machine-learning based approach to measuring constructs through text analysis;European Journal of Marketing;Purpose: This paper aims to develop a novel and generalizable machine-learning based method of measuring established marketing constructs through passive analysis of consumer-generated textual data. The authors term this method scale-directed text analysis. Design/methodology/approach: The method first develops a dictionary of words related to specific dimensions of a construct that is used to assess textual data from any source for a specific meaning. The method explicitly recognizes both specific words and the strength of their underlying sentiment. Findings: Results calculated using this new approach are statistically equivalent to responses to traditional marketing scale items. These results demonstrate the validity of the authors’ methodology and show its potential to complement traditional survey approaches to assessing marketing constructs. Research limitations/implications: The method we outline relies on machine learning and thus requires either large volumes of text or a large number of cases. Results are reliable only at the aggregate level. Practical implications: The method detail provides a means of less intrusive data collection such as through scraped social media postings. Alternatively, it also provides a means of analyzing data collected through more naturalistic methods such as open-response forms or even spoken language, both likely to increase response rates. Originality/value: Scale-directed text analysis goes beyond traditional methods of conducting simple sentiment analysis and word frequency or percentage counts. It combines the richness of traditional textual and sentiment analysis with the theoretical structure and analytical rigor provided by traditional marketing scales, all in an automatic process.;11;6;Construct measurement | Machine learning | Text mining | Text scraping;2020;Marketing;23;European Journal of Marketing

This research investigates salespeople’s use of influence tactics as textual cues to manage buyers’ attention during B2B e-negotiations to win sales contract award. Drawing on studies of attention as a selection heuristic, the authors advance the literature on mechanisms of sales influence by theorizing buyer attention as a key mediating variable between the use of influence tactics and contract award. They use a unique, longitudinal panel spanning more than two years of email communications between buyers and salespeople during B2B sales negotiations to develop a validated corpus of textual cues that are diagnostic of salespeople’s influence tactics in e-negotiations. These e-communications data are augmented by salesperson in-depth interviews and survey, archival performance data, and a controlled experimental study with professional salespeople. The obtained results indicate that the concurrent use of compliance or internalization-based tactics as textual cues bolsters buyers’ attention and is associated with greater likelihood of contract award. In contrast, concurrent use of compliance and internalization-based tactics is prone to degrade buyer attention and likely to put the salesperson at a disadvantage in closing the contract award.;37;3;business to business | buyer attention | e-communication | linguistic | machine learning | negotiation | selling | text analysis;2020;Business and International Management | Marketing;68;Journal of Marketing

Drawing on upper echelon theory and the interactionist theory of job performance, we explain how certain personality traits from the five-factor model are relevant to the job demands a CMO faces in technology-based new ventures. We build a multi-source dataset on 627 new ventures and use a novel approach to measuring personality that is based on computer text analysis—specifically, the LIWC application—which we apply to the CMOs’ Twitter accounts. Our findings indicate that a CMO’s extraversion positively moderates the relationship between a new venture’s maturity and web traffic, while a CMO’s conscientiousness is a negative moderator of this relationship.

This paper aims to explore these characteristics to develop a typology of art consumers using a mixed method approach over several studies. Design/methodology/approach: This is achieved by analyzing qualitative data, gathered via semi-structured interviews of art collectors, and quantitatively by means of natural language processing analysis and automated text analysis and using correspondence analysis to analyze and present the results. Findings: The study’s findings reveal four distinct clusters of art collectors based on their “Big Five” personality traits, as well as uncovering insights into how these types talk about their possessions. Research limitations/implications: In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of consumers that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions in other markets.

However, it is challenging to negotiate user-generated content owing to its lack of structure and the enormous amount generated. This study focuses on the hashtag, a metadata tag that reflects customers’ brand perception through social media platforms. Online users share their knowledge and impressions using a wide variety of hashtags. We examine hashtags that co-occur with particular branded hashtags on the social media platform, Instagram, to derive insights about brand perception. We apply text mining technology and network analysis to identify the perceptions of brand images among consumers on the site, where this helps distinguish among the diverse personalities of the brands.

By understanding negative sentiment and sentiment recovery across an entire retail banking sector, the research exposed a unique view of banking in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The study made use of both a sentiment and topic analysis of over 1.7 million social media posts in South Africa. The methodology made use of both NLP and human validation techniques to measure changes in social media sentiment during online firestorms. This measurement included each of South Africa's major retail banks over a twelve month period. Findings: From the analysis, key trigger characteristics for these firestorms (product failures, service failures, social failures and communication failures) were categorised. In addition, the average duration of a firestorm was calculated and factors that impact sentiment recovery were explored. Originality/value: The study was located in South Africa and, unlike firm level studies, researched nWOM for the whole retail banking sector.

Moreover, there is evidence to support that customer rating inflation is occurring on social media sites over time, especially in the sharing economy, and especially with regard to travel and tourism experiences. This paper conceptualizes how customer experiences are reduced into customer reviews and further abridged into customer ratings in both the traditional and sharing economy contexts. We propose that customers observe how service providers present themselves as a professional (established chain hotel) or amateur (owner operated vacation rental apartment), and then form different service expectations and perceptions accordingly.

The might of marketing has duped clients with hyped promises of illusive actionable insights delivered through fast, sexy interfaces, yet the industry is not delivering the value it promises. This paper explores the reasons behind the failure to deliver this expected value. It will define the terms ‘value’, ‘insight’ and ‘actionable insight’. It will use these definitions to identify where and why industry practice fails to meet these fundamental expectations. A short case study is included to provide an example of how emotion analytics of consumer-generated unstructured text data can help deliver meaningful and genuinely actionable insights.;0;1;Actionable insights | AI | Big Data | Consumer data | Emotion analytics | Hybrid text analytics | NLP | Text analytics | Unstructured text;2020;Strategy and Management | Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty | Marketing;19;Applied Marketing Analytics

India's rate of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing day by day, placing India in the top ten emitters in the world. Air pollution is one of the significant contributors to the greenhouse effect. Transportation contributes about 10% of the air pollution in India. The Indian government is taking steps to reduce air pollution by encouraging the use of electric vehicles. But, success depends on consumer's sentiment, perception and understanding towards Electric Vehicles (EV). This case study tried to capture the feeling, attitude, and emotions of Indian consumers' towards electric vehicles. The main objective of this study was to extract opinions valuable to prospective buyers (to know what is best for them), marketers (for determining what features should be advertised) and manufacturers (for deciding what features should be improved) using Deep Learning techniques (e.g Doc2Vec Algorithm, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). Due to the very nature of social media data, big data platform was chosen to analyze the sentiment towards EV. Deep Learning based techniques were preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic regression and Decision tree, etc.) due to its superior text mining capabilities. Two years data (2016 to 2018) were collected from different social media platform for this case study. The results showed the efficiency of deep learning algorithms and found CNN yield better results in-compare to others. The proposed optimal model will help consumers, designers and manufacturers in their decision-making capabilities to choose, design and manufacture EV.;50;1;Big data | Deep learning | Electric vehicles | India | Sentiment analysis;2020;Marketing;111;Industrial Marketing Management

This study aims to examine the helpfulness and economic impact of multidimensional rating systems and the moderating effect of product type (ordinary, premium) from the perspective of product line. To identify the different effects of different product characteristics on consumers' behavior, multidimensional ratings and textual reviews are classified into two different sets according to the product attributes (functional, hedonic). Besides, the effects of review valence are considered simultaneously. Econometric analysis and text mining are conducted on the real data from autohome.com, a leading Chinese automobile rating platform. Results show that (a) in terms of perceived helpfulness, reviews with positive functional ratings or with negative hedonic ratings are perceived more helpful for ordinary product, whereas reviews with positive hedonic ratings are perceived more helpful for premium product. (b) Regarding product sales, the impacts of functional and hedonic ratings on product sales are inverted U-shape. Furthermore, for ordinary product, variance of functional ratings has a negative effect on product sales, whereas hedonic ratings variance has an opposite impact. Surprisingly, ordinary product consumers tend to pay more attention to the negative hedonic reviews, whereas premium product consumers concentrate more on the negative functional reviews. In summary, various influences of multidimensional reviews and ratings across product type on review helpfulness and product sales are deeply explored in this study, suggesting that firms' online marketing strategies should be contingent on product type and characteristics.;10;4;NA;2020;Social Psychology | Applied Psychology;60;Journal of Consumer Behaviour

Apart from helping in transport, it is also used for its milk. Camel's milk is used worldwide because of its salty taste. However, it has many beneficial effects such as cure for autism and helps to control diabetes, allergy, and also prevents liver cirrhosis. Objective of this study is to analyze the ways to make people purchase and consume camel milk. In the last few years, awareness about nutritional and medicinal benefits of camel milk has rapidly increased. Consequently, the demand of the product has also increased. Objective of this article is to analyze the consumers’ willingness to buy camel milk before and after knowing its health benefits. It also explores the linkage between lifestyle diseases and consumer’s willingness to buy. We analyzed data in two stages. Initially, we did qualitative analysis with twitter text mining to understand customer’s sentiments about camel milk. Later, primary data was collected through structured questionnaire from a sample of 120 respondents by convenience sampling for quantitative analysis. There is a significant increase in the proportion of people willing to buy camel milk and once they were aware of the benefits, people are willing to buy more after knowing the benefits. People exposed to lifestyle diseases are more willing to buy camel milk. Hence, support of market-based awareness campaigns to stimulate demand for quality camel milk among consumers can be realized through information dissemination and awareness campaign.;4;4;Awareness | camel milk | health benefits | willingness to buy;2020;Business and International Management | Food Science | Marketing;58;Journal of International Food and Agribusiness Marketing

The authors overcome this challenge by applying deep learning–based natural language processing on data that tracks individual-level review reading, searching, and purchasing behaviors on an e-commerce site to investigate how consumers use review content. They extract quality and price content from 500,000 reviews of 600 product categories and achieve two objectives. First, the authors describe consumers’ review-content-reading behaviors. Although consumers do not read review content all the time, they do rely on it for products that are expensive or of uncertain quality. Second, the authors quantify the causal impact of read-review content on sales by using supervised deep learning to tag six theory-driven content dimensions and applying a regression discontinuity in time design. They find that aesthetics and price content significantly increase conversion across almost all product categories. Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6% price cut for boosting conversion.;63;3;consumer purchase journey | deep learning | economic impact of text | natural language processing | product reviews | regression discontinuity in time;2019;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;56;Journal of Marketing Research

317;57214915342;Pearson A.;Pearson;Intelligencia Limited;Hong Kong;Hong Kong;Personalisation the artificial intelligence way;Journal of Digital and Social Media Marketing;The era of artificial intelligence (AI) has arrived. Companies all over the world are championing their latest progress with AI, machine learning and deep learning, even though most of it is far short of anything that could be described as a breakthrough. Unfortunately, this excitement does not always translate into quantifiable success — it can take up to six months to go from concept to production, and even then, only one in three AI projects turns out successful. These odds might be low, but the effort is well worth it as the potential payoff could be huge. This paper describes five different types of AI — sound, time series, text, image and video — and illustrates various ways that AI can be used, including in customer relationship management, e-commerce, customer recommendations, security, voice assistance and natural language processing for customer understanding. This article argues that AI will become the basis for a level of customer personalisation that will not only be recognised but soon be demanded by fickle customers everywhere. As the paper will show, it is imperative for brands to utilise AI in their marketing because it allows them to have both a single view of the customer as well as a single view of their media.;6;1;Artificial intelligence | Chatbots | Customer lifecycle | Deep learning | Emotional recognition | Image search | Lookalike marketing | Machine learning | Personalisation | Programmatic advertising | Psychometrics | Real-time marketing | Voice recognition | Voice-assisted search | Website morphing;2019;Communication | Marketing;49;Journal of Digital and Social Media Marketing

This textual information has a substantial and significant ability to predict whether borrowers will pay back the loan above and beyond the financial and demographic variables commonly used in models predicting default. The authors use text-mining and machine learning tools to automatically process and analyze the raw text in over 120,000 loan requests from Prosper, an online crowdfunding platform. Including in the predictive model the textual information in the loan significantly helps predict loan default and can have substantial financial implications. The authors find that loan requests written by defaulting borrowers are more likely to include words related to their family, mentions of God, the borrower’s financial and general hardship, pleading lenders for help, and short-term-focused words. The authors further observe that defaulting loan requests are written in a manner consistent with the writing styles of extroverts and liars.;72;3;consumer finance | loan default | machine learning | text mining;2019;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;83;Journal of Marketing Research

Yet the way in which market-oriented firms seek to achieve superior rents is substantively different from that of entrepreneurially oriented firms which could lead to differential impacts of EO and MO on firm risk. In this study, the authors employ a text mining technique to assess firms' EO and MO and examine the impact of these two strategic orientations on shareholder risk outcomes. The results show that while EO increases idiosyncratic risk, MO decreases it. However, only EO decreases systematic risk.

However, the mechanism via which such improved well-being results or so-called “transformation” occurs, is not well understood. The purpose of this paper is to examine the claims made in the TSR literature to identity the themes and scholarly meaning of “transformative” service exchange; ascertain the mechanisms used in service contexts to realize transformation, including to motivate long-term, sustainable societal change; and develop a transformative service exchange continuum to guide research and managerial approaches that aim to create uplifting social change. The authors recommend their continuum as a framework to inform how social marketing and service scholars design service solutions to address wicked social problems. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a qualitative study where Leximancer, a text-mining tool, is used to visualize the structure of themes and concepts that define transformative service exchanges as explained and applied in the literature. Additionally, a profiling analysis of transformation as it is discussed in the TSR literature is used to identify the mechanisms that service marketers have developed to establish current theorization of service thinking for social change. These qualitative phases of analysis then inform the development of the transformative service exchange continuum. Findings: A scoping review identified 51 articles across 12 journals, based on this study’s selection criteria for identifying transformative service exchanges. The Leximancer analysis systematically and efficiently guided the authors’ interpretation of the large data corpus and was used in the identification of service themes. The use of text-mining software afforded a detailed lens to enrich the authors’ interpretation and clarification of six high-level concepts for inclusion on a transformative service exchange continuum. Originality/value: This paper aims to unpack the meaning of transformative service exchange by highlighting the mechanism(s) used by researchers when designing social change outcomes. It contributes to TSR via the development of the continuum across micro, meso and macro levels. The temporal nature of transformative service exchanges is also elucidated. This continuum integrates current TSR studies and can guide future service studies in the TSR and social marketing domains.";35;2;Qualitative research | Service ecosystem | Social marketing | Transformative;2019;Marketing;86;Journal of Services Marketing

321;57283351000;Srivastava V.;Srivastava;Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management;Mumbai;India;Enhancing the Helpfulness of Online Consumer Reviews: The Role of Latent (Content) Factors;Journal of Interactive Marketing;Past empirical studies have analysed the influence of manifest online review content factors and the reviewer-related factors on online review helpfulness. However, the influence of latent content factors, which are implied from the text and that result in the differential helpfulness perceptions of review receivers, have been ignored. Hence, using the lens of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), we develop a comprehensive model to study the influence of content- and reviewer-related factors on review helpfulness. This study not only includes the manifest content-related and reviewer-related factors, but also the latent content factors consisting of argument quality (comprehensiveness, clarity, readability and relevance) and message valence. The study initially employs a manual content analysis to analyse the argument quality of ~500 TripAdvisor reviews (Study 1). Subsequently, model testing techniques are used to study the holistic and relative influence of these different factors on review helpfulness. In the validation study (Study 2), Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques are used to extract latent content information and test the above model with 50,000 reviews from Yelp.com. The results show that latent review content variables like argument quality and valence influence the helpfulness of the reviews better and beyond the previously studied, manifest review content- and reviewer-related factors.;96;2;Argument quality | Content analysis | Message valence | Natural language processing | Online consumer reviews | Review helpfulness | Text mining;2019;Business and International Management | Marketing;81;Journal of Interactive Marketing

Current theory does not offer sufficient explanation for how households will engage; hence, this paper aims to address an important gap by examining how households set “rules of engagement” for connected-home technologies in the context of electricity use and monitoring. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the extant psychology, technology and engagement literature is conducted and yields two research questions for exploration. The research questions are addressed via 43 in-depth household interviews. Analysis includes thematic analysis and computerized text analysis. Findings: The results include a typology of technology engagement (the “PIP typology”) and discuss three main roles for technology in assisting households: intern, assistant and manager. Key contributions are as follows: consumers in household settings may experience “compromised engagement” where the perceived middle option is selected even if no-one selected that option originally; households open to using connected-home technologies are often taking advantage of their ability to “delegate” engagement to technology, and because consumers humanize technology, they also expect technology to follow social roles and boundaries. Research limitations/implications: Future research may examine the PIP typology quantitatively and/or in different contexts and would benefit from a longitudinal study to examine how household technology engagement evolves.

This paper aims to explore the current scope of research in regard to emerging service technologies by comparing the content of articles in academic journals with practitioner-oriented publication outlets. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 5,118 technology-related articles from service journals, service conferences, business journals and business magazines are analyzed. Text-mining on abstracts is used for the thematic and semantic analysis. Common research themes and their relationships are depicted in a two-dimensional structured network. Further, the sample is analyzed regarding various technologies mentioned in the Gartner Hype Cycle. Findings: The paper reveals differences in academic and business perspectives in regard to service technologies. In comparison to business journals, scientific service research is more focused on customer-related aspects of technology. Service research has a less concrete focus on technology than in business publications. Still, service conference articles show a broader scope of emerging service technologies than academic journal articles.

However, they are unsure about B2B-SIs’ effects on firm value or risk, especially relative to those of B2C-SIs. The authors address this problem by developing hypotheses that relate the number of B2B-SIs and B2C-SIs to firm value and firm risk together with the moderators (the number of product innovations and customer-focus innovations). To test the hypotheses, the authors develop and estimate a model using unique panel data of 2,263 SIs across 15 industries over eight years assembled from multiple data sources and controlling for firm- and market-specific factors, heterogeneity, and endogeneity. They analyze innovation announcements using natural language processing. The results show that B2B-SIs have a positive effect on firm value and an insignificant influence on firm risk. Importantly, the effect of a B2B-SI on firm value is significantly greater than that of a B2C-SI. Unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is greater when the firm has more product innovations. Surprisingly, unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is less positive when the SIs emphasize customers. These findings offer important insights about the relative value of B2B-SIs.;49;2;B2B marketing | finance–marketing interface | innovation | machine learning | natural language processing | services | shareholder value | strategy;2019;Business and International Management | Marketing;75;Journal of Marketing

Surprisingly, unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is less positive when the SIs emphasize customers. These findings offer important insights about the relative value of B2B-SIs.;49;2;B2B marketing | finance–marketing interface | innovation | machine learning | natural language processing | services | shareholder value | strategy;2019;Business and International Management | Marketing;75;Journal of Marketing
331;57196377670;Zhang J.;Zhang;University of Massachusetts Boston;Boston;United States;What’s yours is mine: exploring customer voice on Airbnb using text-mining approaches;Journal of Consumer Marketing;"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate customers’ experiences with Airbnb by text-mining customer reviews posted on the platform and comparing the extracted topics from online reviews between Airbnb and the traditional hotel industry using topic modeling. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses text-mining approaches, including content analysis and topic modeling (latent Dirichlet allocation method), to examine 1,026,988 Airbnb guest reviews of 50,933 listings in seven cities in the USA. Findings: The content analysis shows that negative reviews are more authentic and credible than positive reviews on Airbnb and that the occurrence of social words is positively related to positive emotion in reviews, but negatively related to negative emotion in reviews. A comparison of reviews on Airbnb and hotel reviews shows unique topics on Airbnb, namely, “late check-in”, “patio and deck view”, “food in kitchen”, “help from host”, “door lock/key”, “sleep/bed condition” and “host response”. Research limitations/implications: The topic modeling result suggests that Airbnb guests want to get to know and connect with the local community; thus, help from hosts on ways they can authentically experience the local community would be beneficial. In addition, the results suggest that customers emphasize their interaction with hosts; thus, to improve customer satisfaction, Airbnb hosts should interact with guests and respond to guests’ inquiries quickly. Practical implications: Hotel managers should design marketing programs that fulfill customers’ desire for authentic and local experiences. The results also suggest that peer-to-peer accommodation platforms should improve online review systems to facilitate authentic reviews and help guests have a smooth check-in process. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine consumer reviews in detail in the sharing economy and compare topics from consumer reviews between Airbnb and hotels.";52;1;Airbnb | Consumer reviews | Sharing economy | Text-mining | Topic modelling;2019;Business and International Management | Marketing;49;Journal of Consumer Marketing
332;57191190494;Nikiforova N.D.;Nikiforova;Università degli Studi di Firenze;Florence;Italy;Measuring Matching among Brand Associations in the Fashion Online Communities;Micro and Macro Marketing;In this manuscript a novel approach to measure brand association matching in virtual environments is applied. This innovative approach allows to compare company-defined with consumers-perceived brand associations in online brand studies also in terms of strength. It combines: i) existing text-mining techniques to collect the data from online communities, and ii) Hybrid Log-Linear models for estimating the company-defined and the consumers-perceived brand association matching and strength. This approach provides an innovative marketing tool for companies and brand managers for defining the brand communication as well as the brand strategies. The proposed method is applied to real data extracted from online fashion communities and related to a famous fashion brand.;0;1;Brand alignment | brand association strength | Hybrid Log-Linear models | text-mining | virtual communities;2019;Marketing;28;Micro and Macro Marketing
333;57194275758;Becagli C.;Becagli;Università degli Studi di Firenze;Florence;Italy;Product recall and brand association. A netnographic analysis;Micro and Macro Marketing;According to European legislation, withdrawal of a food product from the market is mandatory whenever the company that produced it or distributed it has doubts about its compliance with food safety requirements. If the food product has already been made available to consumers, the company is obliged to inform them on why it has to be withdrawn, and, if other measures for health protection are insufficient, the same company is bound to recall the non-compliant product. Cases of withdrawal or recall of food products occur almost on a daily basis in Italy. And this is extremely likely to create serious issues to the companies involved, damaging brand image, while losing trust on the side of consumers. Also, the relationship between consumers and brands constantly happens on a double track, physical and virtual. The latter concerns, in particular, the exchange of information, perceptions and feelings that develop within the virtual community of consumers. Through the analysis of these online communities, and focusing on key components of brand association, this paper aims to assess how recalling food products negatively impacts on brand image.;1;2;brand association | Brand image | netnography | product recall | text-mining | virtual community;2019;Marketing;32;Micro and Macro Marketing

They customize a neural network language model to derive latent product attributes by analyzing the co-occurrences of products in shopping baskets. Applying dimensionality reduction to the latent attributes yields a two-dimensional product map. This method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that are readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The approach has high usability because it is automated, is scalable and does not require a priori assumptions. Its results are easy to interpret and update as new market basket data are collected. The authors validate their approach both by conducting an extensive simulation study and by comparing their results with those of state-of-the-art, econometric methods for modeling product relationships.

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, real-time Big Data has been used and analysed through support vector machine, to segregate positive and negative eWOM. Thereafter, using natural language processing algorithms, this study has classified the triggers of positive eWOM based on their relative importance across six product categories. Findings: The most important triggers of positive eWOM (like product experience, product type, product characteristics) were similar across different product categories. The second-level antecedents of positive eWOM included the person(s) for whom the product is purchased, the price and the source of the product, packaging and eagerness in patronising a brand. Practical implications: The findings of this study indicate that the marketers who are active in the digital forum should encourage and incentivise their satisfied consumers to disseminate positive eWOM. Consumers with special interest for any product type (mothers or doctors for baby food) may be incentivised to write positive eWOM about the product’s ingredients/characteristics. Companies can launch the sequels of existing television or online advertisements addressing “for whom the product is purchased”. Originality/value: This study identified the triggers of the positive eWOM using real-time Big Data extracted from online purchase platforms.

In this research, the contribution of the sensorial dimension to CSE research is emphasized. Senses are especially important in forming perceptions within servicescapes that are typically rich in sensory stimuli. Design/methodology/approach: This study systematically identifies 258 articles published between 1994 and 2018 in services and marketing journals. The analysis uses a text mining approach with the Leximancer software to extract research concepts and their relationships. Findings: The results demonstrate a shift from CSE research focused on brands and products toward value and interaction, around three focal areas: service system architecture, with its value creation processes; servicescape, with an increasingly digital interaction interface and outcome measures, with a stronger focus on emotional and relational metrics. In CSE research, the physical, social and cognitive dimensions are mostly researched in the focal areas of servicescape and outcome measures. Although important in practice, the sensorial dimension is the least investigated CSE dimension in service marketing research. Text mining insights demonstrate rich opportunities for sensorial research, particularly in studies on servicescape. Practical implications: The synthesis will inform managers and service providers which elements of CSE are most relevant to customers when forming perceptions. These insights help service providers to control, manage and design (multi)-sensory stimuli that influence how customers will make sense of the servicescape. Originality/value: This research is one of the first studies to examine the conceptual structure of CSE with a text mining approach that systematically analyzes a large set of articles, therein reducing the potential for researchers’ interpretative bias.

The authors develop a comprehensive framework that integrates different drivers of negative eWOM and the response approaches that firms use to engage in and disengage from online conversations with complaining customers. A text-mining study of negative eWOM demonstrates distinct impacts of high-and low-arousal emotions, structural tie strength, and linguistic style match (between sender and brand community) on firestorm potential. The firm’s response must be tailored to the intensity of arousal in the negative eWOM to limit the virality of potential online firestorms. The impact of initiated firestorms can be mitigated by distinct firm responses over time, and the effectiveness of different disengagement approaches also varies with their timing. For managers, these insights provide guidance on how to detect and reduce the virality of online firestorms.;154;5;Message dynamics | Online brand community | Online firestorms | Text mining | Word of mouth;2019;Business and International Management | Marketing;81;Journal of Marketing

Laddering interviews were conducted to capture the essence of CPVs, and then text-mining techniques were applied to extract key consumer values from the interviews. Six dimensions of CPV, namely, design, emotional, functional, monetary, guarantee, and social, were identified. The construct validity of these six dimensions was demonstrated through a rigorous sorting process. A best–worst scaling (BWS) survey was then implemented based on these six value dimensions to investigate consumers’ preference for each dimension in three critical decision-making phases of mobile marketing campaigns. Statistical analysis of the BWS data showed that significant dynamic differences exist among these six value dimensions in each phase.

Increasingly, this content is generated on smartphones rather than personal computers (PCs). This article argues that because of its physically constrained nature, smartphone (vs. PC) use leads consumers to generate briefer content, which encourages them to focus on the overall gist of their experiences. This focus on gist, in turn, tends to manifest as reviews that emphasize the emotional aspects of an experience in lieu of more specific details. Across five studies—two field studies and three controlled experiments—the authors use natural language processing tools and human assessments to analyze the linguistic characteristics of user-generated content. The findings support the thesis that smartphone use results in the creation of content that is less specific and privileges affect—especially positive affect—relative to PC-generated content. The findings also show that differences in emotional content are driven by the tendency to generate briefer content on smartphones rather than user self-selection, differences in topical content, or timing of writing.

Since there is no contact with the product, people have to rely on the description of the seller, knowing that sometimes it may be biased and not entirely true. Therefore, review systems emerged to provide more trustworthy sources of information, since customer opinions may be less biased. However, the need to control the consumers’ opinion increased once sellers realized the importance of reviews and their direct impact on sales. One of the methods often used was to offer customers a specific product in exchange for an honest review. Yet, these incentivized reviews bias results and skew the overall rating of the products. The current study uses a data mining approach to predict whether or not a new review published was incentivized based on several review features such as the overall rating, the helpfulness rate, and the review length, among others. Additionally, the model was enriched with sentiment score features of the reviews computed through the VADER algorithm. The results provide an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon by identifying the most relevant features which enable to differentiate an incentivized from a non-incentivized review, thus providing users and companies with a simple set of rules to identify reviews that are biased without any disclaimer. Such rules include the length of a review, its helpfulness rate, and the overall sentiment polarity score.;27;4;Incentivized online reviews | Sentiment analysis | Text mining;2019;Marketing;61;Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services

Many marketing applications require structuring this data at scales non-accessible to human coding, e.g., to detect communication shifts in sentiment or other researcher-defined content categories. Several methods have been proposed to automatically classify unstructured text. This paper compares the performance of ten such approaches (five lexicon-based, five machine learning algorithms) across 41 social media datasets covering major social media platforms, various sample sizes, and languages. So far, marketing research relies predominantly on support vector machines (SVM) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Across all tasks we study, either random forest (RF) or naive Bayes (NB) performs best in terms of correctly uncovering human intuition. In particular, RF exhibits consistently high performance for three-class sentiment, NB for small samples sizes. SVM never outperform the remaining methods. All lexicon-based approaches, LIWC in particular, perform poorly compared with machine learning. In some applications, accuracies only slightly exceed chance. Since additional considerations of text classification choice are also in favor of NB and RF, our results suggest that marketing research can benefit from considering these alternatives.;210;4;Machine learning | Natural language processing | Sentiment analysis | Social media | Text classification | User-generated content;2019;Marketing;74;International Journal of Research in Marketing

However, such opinions reflect different degrees of engagement which may affect the decisions in different forms. The aim of this study is to analyze the dimensions of online customer engagement and associated concepts (involvement, emotional states, experience and brand advocacy) in customers’ online reviews through text-mining and sentiment analysis trends. The current study focuses on Yelp.com comments and includes a random sample of 15,000 unique reviews of restaurants, hotels and nightlife entertainment in eleven cities in the USA. A customer engagement dictionary is created, based on previously validated scales and extended using WordNet 2.1. The research findings reveal a high impact of the engagement cognitive processing dimension and hedonic experience on customers’ review endeavor. Results further indicate that customers seem to be more engaged in positively advocating a company/brand than the contrary. Companies that listen to such feedback may be more able to align with consumers’ expectations and, therefore, have a better competitive advantage in the market.;82;3;brand advocacy | Customer engagement | emotional states | involvement | online experience | user-generated content;2019;Management Information Systems | Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management | Marketing;124;Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management

354;23101664700;Toubia O.;Toubia;NA;NA;NA;Extracting Features of Entertainment Products: A Guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation Approach Informed by the Psychology of Media Consumption;Journal of Marketing Research;The authors propose a quantitative approach for describing entertainment products, in a way that allows for improving the predictive performance of consumer choice models for these products. Their approach is based on the media psychology literature, which suggests that people’s consumption of entertainment products is influenced by the psychological themes featured in these products. They classify psychological themes on the basis of the “character strengths” taxonomy from the positive psychology literature (Peterson and Seligman 2004). They develop a natural language processing tool, guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), that automatically extracts a set of features of entertainment products from their descriptions. Guided LDA is flexible enough to allow features to be informed by psychological themes while allowing other relevant dimensions to emerge. The authors apply this tool to movies and show that guided LDA features help better predict movie-watching behavior at the individual level. They find this result with both award-winning movies and blockbuster movies. They illustrate the potential of the proposed approach in pure content-based predictive models of consumer behavior, as well as in hybrid predictive models that combine content-based models with collaborative filtering. They also show that guided LDA can improve the performance of models that predict aggregate outcomes.;59;4;entertainment industry | media psychology | natural language processing | positive psychology | topic models;2019;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;74;Journal of Marketing Research

Thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) text analytics, a lot of information typically missed in sentiment analysis can now be analysed and early warning of issues flagged much earlier. This paper looks at how AI text analytics will succeed sentiment analysis and how it can identify additional customer emotion and intent by using concepts rather than simple keywords in its analysis. The paper also looks at how the most successful AI text analytics feature human-in-the-loop technology that optimises the combination of automation and human involvement. This makes the need for data scientists to run day-to-day models obsolete as the human input can come from the business user instead. The paper presents examples of how AI text analytics and emotions analytics can be applied, and argues that AI text analytics can reduce reliance on data scientists, provide early warnings of issues and analyse a much deeper level of sentiment and customer intent with higher levels of accuracy.;1;1;AI | Customer data | Customer satisfaction | Data science | Machine learning | Sentiment analysis | Text analytics;2019;Strategy and Management | Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty | Marketing;7;Applied Marketing Analytics

User-generated content (UGC) is a promising alternative source for identifying customer needs. However, established methods are neither efficient nor effective for large UGC corpora because much content is noninformative or repetitive. We propose a machine-learning approach to facilitate qualitative analysis by selecting content for efficient review. We use a convolutional neural network to filter out noninformative content and cluster dense sentence embeddings to avoid sampling repetitive content. We further address two key questions: Are UGC-based customer needs comparable to interview-based customer needs? Do the machine-learning methods improve customer-need identification? These comparisons are enabled by a custom data set of customer needs for oral care products identified by professional analysts using industry-standard experiential interviews. The analysts also coded 12,000 UGC sentences to identify which previously identified customer needs and/or new customer needs were articulated in each sentence. We show that (1) UGC is at least as valuable as a source of customer needs for product development, likely more valuable, compared with conventional methods, and (2) machine-learning methods improve efficiency of identifying customer needs from UGC (unique customer needs per unit of professional services cost).;198;2;Customer needs | Deep learning | Machine learning | Market research | Natural language processing | Online reviews | Text mining | User-generated content | Voice of the customer;2019;Business and International Management | Marketing;62;Marketing Science

We show that (1) UGC is at least as valuable as a source of customer needs for product development, likely more valuable, compared with conventional methods, and (2) machine-learning methods improve efficiency of identifying customer needs from UGC (unique customer needs per unit of professional services cost).;198;2;Customer needs | Deep learning | Machine learning | Market research | Natural language processing | Online reviews | Text mining | User-generated content | Voice of the customer;2019;Business and International Management | Marketing;62;Marketing Science

However, little is known about their emotional effects in individuals. Feelings generated by threat appeals have proved to be ambiguous. Considering that understanding the emotional effects of message frames has implications in long-term behaviour change, this paper aims at understanding the feelings generated by threat appeals, considering the inconsistent findings in the literature. The research analyses the feelings produced by threat appeals in two social networks - Facebook and YouTube. A sentiment analysis of forty non-governmental campaigns regarding anorexia nervosa awareness was conducted through two methodological forms. First, we have analysed the content of the comments made by users by text analysis; second, we have coded the emoji expressing feelings from the users in the same campaigns and have quantified their interactions. Results indicate that feelings generated by threat appeals regarding anorexia nervosa campaigns in social media may be both positive and negative, with a great expression of fear, sadness and empathy, corroborating the ambiguous findings. Positive feelings are most prominent in emoji and reveal support, compassion and admiration both for campaign messages and for people suffering from anorexia. Negative feelings, such as fear and sadness, arise especially as a consequence of awareness and concerns. The paper contributes to the discussion of this ambivalent topic of research and also experiments two different sentiment analysis techniques – text and emoji analysis -, with different result outcomes.";14;2;Anorexia campaigns | Emoji analysis | Sentiment analysis | Social media text analysis | Threat appeals;2018;Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;58;International Review on Public and Nonprofit Marketing

Established service quality frameworks such as SERVQUAL and SERVPERF have been applied in the banking sector. While these models are widely accepted, they are expensive because of the need for replication across bank branches. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel, user friendly and cost effective approach by amalgamating the traditional concept of service quality in banks (marketing base) and sentiment analysis literature (information systems base). Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the main objective is to analyze user reviews to better understand the correlation between RATER dimension sentiment scores as independent variables and user overall rating (customer satisfaction) grouping in “good” and “bad” as dependent variable through development of authors’ own logistic regression model using lexicon-based sentiment analysis. The model has been developed for three largest private banks in India pertaining to three banking product categories of loans, savings and current accounts and credit cards. Findings: The results show that the responsiveness and tangibles dimensions significantly impact the user evaluation rating. Even though the three largest private banks in India are concentrating on the tangibles dimension, not all of them are sufficiently focused on the responsiveness dimension. Additionally, customers looking for loan products are more susceptible to negative perceptions on service quality. Originality/value: This study has highlighted two types of scores whereby user provided overall evaluation scores help provide validation to the sentiment scores. The developed model can be used to assess performance of a bank in comparison to its peers and to generate in depth insights on point of parity (POP) and point of difference (POD) fronts.;13;3;Customer satisfaction | Service marketing | Service quality;2018;Marketing;71;International Journal of Bank Marketing

After moving toward cognitive science and corporate strategies in the early 2000s, marketing research returned to its traditional domains of consumer psychologies and customer management. While conscientious consumers are gradually restraining themselves from selfish indulgence, marketers have refocused on a new set of values that encompass mental, experiential, and societal well-being. In this regard, we adopt an unprecedented approach by incorporating topic modeling with social network analysis. The results show that, in terms of topic heterogeneity, the most impactful journals are the most diverse, whereas each runner-up has a unique focus. Among the journals, we detect two major co-authorship communities, and among the topics, we detect three. Further, we find that the communities of the most cited papers are composed of heterogeneous clusters of similar topics. The pivots within, and the bridges between, these communities are also reported.

However, the drivers of such decisions remain underexplored. This study identifies a significant predictor of strategic emphasis, namely, corporate managerial hubris, and reveals some of its boundary conditions. Leveraging a unique dataset based on text mining of press releases issued by over 400 firms across 13 years, the authors demonstrate that high corporate managerial hubris predicts low strategic emphasis on advertising relative to R&D. However, this effect is mitigated significantly by firm maturity, corporate governance, and industry-level strategic emphasis. The results provide novel insights into the effects of hubris on firm spending, the situations wherein marketing decisions tend to be subject to managers’ psychological bias, the means of preventing over- or under-investment in marketing strategy, and the recruitment and training of managers.;24;3;"Advertising | Corporate managerial hubris | R&amp;d | Strategic emphasis";2017;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;98;Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science

397;12139851200;Moon S.;Moon;The University of North Carolina at Charlotte;Charlotte;United States;A picture is worth a thousand words: Translating product reviews into a product positioning map;International Journal of Research in Marketing;Product reviews are becoming ubiquitous on the Web, representing a rich source of consumer information on a wide range of product categories (e.g., wines and hotels). Importantly, a product review reflects not only the perception and preference for a product, but also the acuity, bias, and writing style of the reviewer. This reviewer aspect has been overlooked in past studies that have drawn inferences about brands from online product reviews. Our framework combines ontology learning-based text mining and psychometric techniques to translate online product reviews into a product positioning map, while accounting for the idiosyncratic responses and writing styles of individual reviewers or a manageable number of reviewer groups (i.e., meta-reviewers). Our empirical illustrations using wine and hotel reviews demonstrate that a product review reveals information about the reviewer (for the wine example with a small number of expert reviewers) or the meta-reviewer (for the hotel example with an enormous number of reviewers reduced to a manageable number of meta-reviewers), as well as about the product under review. From a managerial perspective, product managers can use our framework focusing on meta-reviewers (e.g., traveler types and hotel reservation websites in our hotel example) as a way to obtain insights into their consumer segmentation strategy.;43;2;Consumer segmentation | Experience products | Online product reviews | Product positioning map | Psychometrics | Text mining;2017;Marketing;35;International Journal of Research in Marketing
397;7004159593;Kamakura W.A.;Kamakura;Jones Graduate School of Business;Houston;United States;A picture is worth a thousand words: Translating product reviews into a product positioning map;International Journal of Research in Marketing;Product reviews are becoming ubiquitous on the Web, representing a rich source of consumer information on a wide range of product categories (e.g., wines and hotels). Importantly, a product review reflects not only the perception and preference for a product, but also the acuity, bias, and writing style of the reviewer. This reviewer aspect has been overlooked in past studies that have drawn inferences about brands from online product reviews. Our framework combines ontology learning-based text mining and psychometric techniques to translate online product reviews into a product positioning map, while accounting for the idiosyncratic responses and writing styles of individual reviewers or a manageable number of reviewer groups (i.e., meta-reviewers). Our empirical illustrations using wine and hotel reviews demonstrate that a product review reveals information about the reviewer (for the wine example with a small number of expert reviewers) or the meta-reviewer (for the hotel example with an enormous number of reviewers reduced to a manageable number of meta-reviewers), as well as about the product under review.

While previous research has studied the role of content or the role of influence in the spread of social media content separately, none has simultaneously examined both in an effort to assess the relative effects of each. Our modeling approach also accounts for a message's “fit” with users, based on the content of the message and the content of messages typically shared by users. As an empirical application, we examine how Twitter posts originating from top business schools are subsequently rebroadcasted (or retweeted) by other users. We employ an individual-level split hazard model that accounts for variation in rebroadcasting decisions related to (1) content, (2) the content-user fit and (3) the influence of other users. We find that the rebroadcasting a message depends not only on message content but also on the message's fit with a user. Our analysis also yields measures of influence and susceptibility to influence for each user, which can be used to identify influential social media users. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to evaluate different types of seeding strategies designed to increase the reach of social media messages.;102;3;Bayesian estimation | Social influence | Social media | Text mining | Twitter;2017;Marketing;42;International Journal of Research in Marketing

This has made large amount of textual data freely available on the internet for competitive intelligence analysis, which is helping reposition more and more companies for better profit. In order to carry out competitive intelligence, financial institutions need to take note of and analyse their competitor's social media sites. This paper, therefore, aims to help the banking industry in Nigeria understand how to perform a social media competitive analysis and transform social media data into knowledge, which will form the foundation for decision-making and internet marketing of such institutions. The study describes an in-depth case study which applies text mining to analyse unstructured text content on Facebook and Twitter sites of the five largest and leading financial institutions (banks) in Nigeria: Zenith Bank, First Bank, United Bank for Africa, Access Bank and GTBank. Analysing the social media content of these institutions will increase their competitive advantage and also lead to more profit for the banking institutions in question. The results obtained from this research showed that text mining is able to reveal uncommon and non-Trivial trend for competitive advantage from social media data, and also provide specific recommendations to help banks maximise their competitive edge.;15;3;Banking | Clustering | Competitive intelligence | Facebook | Sentiment analysis | Social media | Text mining | Twitter;2017;Marketing;46;International Journal of Internet Marketing and Advertising

The literature suggests that creativity results from the optimal balance between novelty and familiarity, which can be measured based on the combinations of words in an idea. We build semantic networks where nodes represent word stems in a particular idea generation topic, and edge weights capture the degree of novelty versus familiarity of word stem combinations (i.e., the weight of an edge that connects two word stems measures their scaled co-occurrence in the relevant language). Each idea contains a set of word stems, which form a semantic subnetwork. The edge weight distribution in that subnetwork reflects how the idea balances novelty with familiarity. Based on the “beauty in averageness” effect, we hypothesize that ideas with semantic subnetworks that have a more prototypical edge weight distribution are judged as more creative. We show this effect in eight studies involving over 4,000 ideas across multiple domains. Practically, we demonstrate how our research can be used to automatically identify promising ideas and recommend words to users on the fly to help them improve their ideas.;66;2;Creativity | Data mining | Idea generation | Innovation | Text mining;2017;Business and International Management | Marketing;49;Marketing Science

This can enable marketers to analyze the textual content of online reviews with the aim to understand the role of emotions and how they can affect other customers. In this paper, we present an approach to extracting emotion content from online reviews in order to measure the importance of various emotion dimensions within different product categories. The approach uses an emotion lexicon to extract emotion terms, while it also builds a classification model to measure the importance of emotion dimensions based on the quality of reviews. Review quality is measured based on the usefulness of online customer reviews, which are perceived and evaluated by other customers through their helpfulness ratings. This approach allows the identification of emotion dimensions that characterize qualitative reviews. The empirical evaluation in our study suggests that trust, joy, and anticipation are the most decisive emotion dimensions, although substantial variance across product categories can also be detected. Additionally, we compared two contrasting emotion dictionaries. One lexicon was crowd-funded and contained a large vocabulary, whereas the other was more focused and smaller, since it was created word-wise by an expert. Our empirical findings indicate that the crowd-funded solution outperforms its smaller counterpart in terms of classification precision. The main implication of this study is that it adds an emotional perspective to the broad set of existing tools that marketers employ to analyzing online reviews.

Stern School of Business;New York;United States;A structured analysis of unstructured big data by leveraging cloud computing;Marketing Science;Accurate forecasting of sales/consumption is particularly important for marketing because this information can be used to adjust marketing budget allocations and overall marketing strategies. Recently, online social platforms have produced an unparalleled amount of data on consumer behavior. However, two challenges have limited the use of these data in obtaining meaningful business marketing insights. First, the data are typically in an unstructured format, such as texts, images, audio, and video. Second, the sheer volume of the data makes standard analysis procedures computationally unworkable. In this study, we combine methods from cloud computing, machine learning, and text mining to illustrate how online platform content, such as Twitter, can be effectively used for forecasting. We conduct our analysis on a significant volume of nearly two billion Tweets and 400 billion Wikipedia pages. Our main findings emphasize that, by contrast to basic surface-level measures such as the volume of or sentiments in Tweets, the information content of Tweets and their timeliness significantly improve forecasting accuracy. Our method endogenously summarizes the information in Tweets. The advantage of our method is that the classification of the Tweets is based on what is in the Tweets rather than preconceived topics that may not be relevant. We also find that, by contrast to Twitter, other online data (e.g., Google Trends, Wikipedia views, IMDB reviews, and Huffington Post news) are very weak predictors of TV show demand because users tweet about TV shows before, during, and after a TV show, whereas Google searches, Wikipedia views, IMDB reviews, and news posts typically lag behind the show.;100;3;Big data | Cloud computing | Google trends | Text mining | Twitter | User generated content;2016;Business and International Management | Marketing;53;Marketing Science

The author studies semantic aspect of methodical training of faculty members at higher educational institutions - the competency to organize student work on making sense of studied conceptions and texts. We substantiate from psychological and pedagogical perspective that semantic analysis is basic for faculty members to carry out different kinds of professional activity. Based on methodological analysis, learning actions composing the essence of semantic analysis are revealed: Establishing relations in studied material like juxtaposing scope and content of conceptions, reflecting the sense (conception) and the meaning (denotation) of names of conceptions. Combination of those actions represents the essence of understanding process while working with educational text. Examples from mathematics course, demonstrating the distinguishing features of semantic analysis, are given. The author offers the technology of training in shaping skills in making semantic text analysis in recursive model of methodical training, built in accordance with cyclic principle. Every cycle of the technology includes methodologic, information and training stage of shaping skills in making semantic text analysis. Recursive technology use in shaping methodical competency of faculty member will make possible to boost solving topical problems of Russian higher education system.;0;1;Educational text | Hermeneutic trend in education | Making sense in educational cognition | Semantics of educational text;2016;Business, Management and Accounting (all);23;International Review of Management and Marketing

Methodology/approach: The authors use the Leximancer computer-aided text analysis program, which reliably and reproducibly identifies the main concepts embedded in the text—their frequency and patterns of co-occurrence—based on the ways words move together in the text. They also identify key concepts that differentiate among the networks of concepts occurring in each of the first four five-year periods of the Journal’s history. Findings: There are four common underlying conceptual themes: relationships, market, study, and business. But the focal mix of concepts has changed over time, from a narrower initial focus on distribution and power and conflict, to a greater focus on firm business marketing strategy and pedagogy, to a focus on networks, the Internet and more collaborative relations, to a focus, in the most recent period, on psycho-social network concepts, such as trust and commitment. Research implications: The results complement and provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing researcher-conducted literature reviews of business marketing and JBBM’s contributions. The methodology provides possibilities for further analysis as it can be extended to analyze the business marketing and wider marketing literature more generally and how it has evolved.

Its intent is to overview how Big Data builds on the former and how each possesses uniqueness. For example, a key strength of consumer panel data is its ability to link consumer characteristics with purchase behavior, while Big Data and its lack of structure has concerns with consumer characteristic revelation, yet can provide strong consumer insights. Overall, the study overviews the potential, issues and future of Big Data in the context of marketing.;9;1;Big data | Consumer panels | Predictive analytic | Purchase behavior | Text analysis;2015;Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous) | Strategy and Management | Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty | Marketing;35;Journal of Marketing Analytics

How to effectively utilize the enormous amount of text information poses a great challenge to marketing researchers and practitioners. This study takes an initial step to investigate the validities and usefulness of text mining, a promising approach in generating valuable information from eWOM communication. Bilateral data were collected from both eWOM senders and readers via two web-based surveys. Results provide initial evidence for the validity and utility of text mining and demonstrate that the linguistic indicators generated by text analysis are predictive of eWOM communicators’ attitudes toward a product or service. Text analysis indicators (e.g., Negations and Money) can explain additional variance in eWOM communicators’ attitudes above and beyond the star ratings and may become a promising supplement to the widely used star ratings as indicators of eWOM valence.;75;2;Attitude | Electronic word-of-mouth | Linguistic indicator | Text mining;2015;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;27;Marketing Letters
422;55876661400;Guo L.;Guo;University of New Hampshire Durham;Durham;United States;Digging for gold with a simple tool: Validating text mining in studying electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communication;Marketing Letters;Text-based electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communication has increasingly become an important channel for consumers to exchange information about products and services. How to effectively utilize the enormous amount of text information poses a great challenge to marketing researchers and practitioners. This study takes an initial step to investigate the validities and usefulness of text mining, a promising approach in generating valuable information from eWOM communication. Bilateral data were collected from both eWOM senders and readers via two web-based surveys. Results provide initial evidence for the validity and utility of text mining and demonstrate that the linguistic indicators generated by text analysis are predictive of eWOM communicators’ attitudes toward a product or service. Text analysis indicators (e.g., Negations and Money) can explain additional variance in eWOM communicators’ attitudes above and beyond the star ratings and may become a promising supplement to the widely used star ratings as indicators of eWOM valence.;75;2;Attitude | Electronic word-of-mouth | Linguistic indicator | Text mining;2015;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;27;Marketing Letters

Percentages of female authors publishing either a single or multiple articles or as first-authors on multiple-authored articles or as authors in any position in multiple-authored articles were mostly less than 35%. These numbers were generally the highest, but mostly under 50%, in the Journal of Consumer Research and were the lowest in Marketing Science. Text mining of abstracts suggested that female authors were more likely to work on topics that fit better with the scope of the Journal of Consumer Research.;0;1;NA;2015;Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;32;Academy of Marketing Studies Journal

State-ofthe- art information technologies are used in order to increase the efficiency of government strategies. They help to turn the audience into an object of manipulation. Many theories studying mass media are focused on the influence the media has on its viewer or reader. Development of satellite television and some other media types that have almost unlimited coverage has increased the opportunities of cultural and information expansion. Mass media is extremely necessary during social development, because without its activity it is impossible to evaluate political consciousness, value system and purposes of all levels of the population and to gain public support of social changes. Nowadays there are two basic theoretical models of studying mass media political influence. The first one studies the influence of mass communications on individual behavior and social life in general. The second one has been developing for the last 30 years under the influence of cultural anthropology, structural theories, semiotics and other crossdisciplinary scientific fields. It was focused on perceiving the connections between “texts,” individuals and big social groups.

One technique that is common but has not been conceptualized is the deliberate change of perspective of specific product or brand attributes. Based on the reframing method used in neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) this technique is conceptualized as message reframing, defined as a communication technique that changes the conceptual and/or emotional setting or viewpoint in relation to how a brand is experienced by placing it in a different frame that fits the same brand equally well or better. The effects of message reframing in contrast to conventional advertisements as well as in contrast to humor and two-sided argumentation are hypothesized and tested in an experimental study. The results reveal that message reframing outplays traditional advertising techniques regarding attention toward the ad, perceived novelty, attitude toward the ad, and attitude toward the brand.

Establishing the veracity of these digital deposits could thus bring key benefits to both online businesses and internet users. Although machine learning techniques are well established for classifying text in terms of their content, techniques to categorise them in terms of their veracity remain a challenge for the domain of feature set extraction and analysis. To date, text categorisation techniques for veracity have reported a wide and inconsistent range of accuracies between 57 and 90 per cent. This article evaluates the accuracy of detecting online deceptive text using a logistic regression classifier based on part of speech tags extracted from a corpus of known truthful and deceptive statements. An accuracy of 72 per cent is achieved by reducing 42 extracted part of speech tags to a feature vector of six using principle component analysis. The results compare favourably to other studies.

432;8683192500;Camiciottoli B.C.;Camiciottoli;Università di Pisa;Pisa;Italy;Exploring brand associations: An innovative methodological approach;European Journal of Marketing;Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory study is to propose a new methodological approach to investigate brand associations. More specifically, the study aims to show how brand associations can be identified and analysed in an online community of international consumers of fashion to determine the degree of matching with company-defined brand associations. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is two-pronged, integrating qualitative market research techniques with quantitative text mining. It was applied to determine types and perceptions of brand associations among fashion bloggers with reference to three leading Italian fashion houses. These were then compared to brand associations found in company-generated texts to measure the degree of matching. Findings: The results showed consistent brand associations across the three brands, as well as substantial matching with company-defined brand associations. In addition, the analysis revealed the presence of distinctive brand association themes that shed further light on how brand attributes were perceived by blog participants. Practical implications: The methods described can be used by managers to identify and reinforce favourable brand associations among consumers. This knowledge can then be applied towards developing and implementing effective brand strategies. Originality/value: The authors propose an interdisciplinary approach to investigate brand associations in online communities. It incorporates text mining and computer-assisted textual analysis as techniques borrowed from the field of linguistics which have thus far seen little application in marketing studies, but can nonetheless provide important insights for strategic brand management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;43;3;Brand associations | Fashion industry | Online communities | Qualitative-quantitative approach | Text mining | Textual analysis;2014;Marketing;56;European Journal of Marketing

433;12139851200;Moon S.;Moon;The University of North Carolina at Charlotte;Charlotte;United States;The impact of text product reviews on sales;European Journal of Marketing;Purpose - The aim of this research is to theorize and demonstrate that analyzing consumers’ text product reviews using text mining can enhance the explanatory power of a product sales model, particularly for hedonic products, which tend to generate emotional and subjective product evaluations. Previous research in this area has been more focused on utilitarian products. Design/methodology/approach - Our text clustering-based procedure segments text reviews into multiple clusters in association with consumers’ numeric ratings to address consumer heterogeneity in taste preferences and quality valuations and the J-distribution of numeric product ratings. This approach is novel in terms of combining text clustering with numeric product ratings to address consumers’ subjective product evaluations. Findings - Using the movie industry as our empirical application, we find that our approach of making use of product text reviews can improve the explanatory power and predictive validity of the box-office sales model. Research limitations/implications - Marketing scholars have actively investigated the impact of consumers’ online product reviews on product sales, primarily focusing on consumers’ numeric product ratings. Recently, studies have also examined user-generated content. Similarly, this study looks into users’ textual product reviews to explain product sales. It remains to be seen how generalizable our empirical results are beyond our movie application. Practical implications - Whereas numeric ratings can indicate how much viewers liked products, consumers’ reviews can convey why viewers liked or disliked them. Therefore, our review analysis can help marketers understand what factors make new products succeed or fail. Originality/value - Primarily our approach is suitable to products subjectively evaluated, mostly, hedonic products. In doing so, we consider consumer heterogeneity contained in reviews through our review clusters based on their divergent impacts on sales.;48;3;Hedonic products | J-distribution | Online product reviews | Product sales | Text clustering;2014;Marketing;50;European Journal of Marketing

This is true not only for new users of goods or services, but also for their producers. They extend the insight into the acceptance of new goods and services, e.g. at the point of sale, from a mere sales and usage quantity oriented point of view to a cause and effect oriented one. Since online reviews by consumers of many goods and services are nowadays widespread and easily available on the internet, the question arises whether their analysis can replace the more traditional approaches to measure technology acceptance, e.g., using questionnaires with TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) items. This paper tries to answer this question using IKEA[U+05F3]s mobile catalogue app as an example. For comparisons reasons, data on the acceptance of the current version of this catalogue is collected in four different ways, (1) as answers to batteries of TAM items, (2) as assignments to pre-defined adjective pairs, (3) as textual likes and dislikes of users (simulating online reviews), and (4) as publicly available (real) reviews by users. The source for (1)-(3) is a survey with a sample of respondents, the source for (4) an online forum. The data is analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) for TAM modeling and text mining for pre-processing the textual data.

Many indicative keywords can be consolidated into keyword groups, sets of associated terms, and thereby used to identify changes over time in the thematic focus of contributions to the Journal. Numerical changes in the frequency of use of words within these keyword groups make it possible to quantify changes over time in the 'footprint' of different thematic areas of interest to marketers.

Instead of the traditional 12 zodiac animals - rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig - McDonald's replaced the pig symbol with a Cupid toy because Valentine's Day fell on the same day as Chinese New Year in 2010 and because the restaurant's Muslim customers do not consume pork. This paper aimed to find out how and why customers of McDonald's rejected the zodiac promotion in Singapore through heated discussions in the media. Following a review of literature on multiculturalism, cultural sensitivity and hybrid cultural theories, a Foucault-based framework of discipline-ethics-performativity guided this qualitative text analysis of 97 documents from forum pages of the Straits Times newspaper and online postings on Asia One and Channel News Asia. Mass media asserted that it was a racial issue related to extreme political correctness that fuelled the controversy but the emerging theory was that there was a cultural territorial clash of discipline structures, ethical moderation, and identity performance. This paper contributes to literature on business in Asia, as there seems to be little research on pig symbolism in Marketing or on the failure of culturally oriented marketing activities. The implication for practice is that the marketing team needs to consider more carefully the fundamental cultural disciplinary structure, ethics responsibility, and identity performativity in a multi-ethnic country. While McDonald's zodiac promotion appeared not to have upset the Muslims in multi-racial Singapore, it would be interesting to research whether there was any online backlash in Malaysia and Indonesia, which have a higher Muslim population. © 2013 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.;2;2;Chinese and Muslim culture | Cultural sensitivity | Pig symbolism | Theory of cultural territorial clash | Zodiac promotion;2013;Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;41;Australasian Marketing Journal

We test the framework using data collected from computer-aided text analysis, expert coders, and secondary sources for 543 IPOs across 43 industries between 2000 and 2004. A Bayesian shrinkage model, which accounts for industry-specific effects and uses latent instrumental variables to address CCO endogeneity, shows that CCOs positively influence IPO outcomes. Furthermore, (1) underwriter reputation and venture funding positively moderate the effects of CCOs; (2) technological and market turbulence positively and institutional complexity negatively moderate the effect of customer orientation; and (3) technological turbulence, competitive intensity, and institutional complexity positively moderate the effect of competitor orientation.

445;6701851923;Pfann G.;Pfann;Maastricht University School of Business and Economics;Maastricht;Netherlands;More than words: The influence of affective content and linguistic style matches in online reviews on conversion rates;Journal of Marketing;Customers increasingly rely on other consumers' reviews to make purchase decisions online. New insights into the customer review phenomenon can be derived from studying the semantic content and style properties of verbatim customer reviews to examine their influence on online retail sites' conversion rates. The authors employ text mining to extract changes in affective content and linguistic style properties of customer book reviews on Amazon.com. A dynamic panel data model reveals that the influence of positive affective content on conversion rates is asymmetrical, such that greater increases in positive affective content in customer reviews have a smaller effect on subsequent increases in conversion rate. No such tapering-off effect occurs for changes in negative affective content in reviews. Furthermore, positive changes in affective cues and increasing congruence with the product interest group's typical linguistic style directly and conjointly increase conversion rates. These findings suggest that managers should identify and promote the most influential reviews in a given product category, provide instructions to stimulate reviewers to write powerful reviews, and adapt the style of their own editorial reviews to the relevant product category. © 2013, American Marketing Association.;456;6;Affective content | Conversion rate | Internet marketing | Linguistic style match | Online customer reviews;2013;Business and International Management | Marketing;79;Journal of Marketing
446;57590036300;Ueda T.;Ueda;Gakushuin University;Tokyo;Japan;Creating value with sales promotion strategies that avoid price discounting;Advances in Business Marketing and Purchasing;This paper introduces the development of a new type of sales promotion strategy tocreate more value for goods and to avoid price discounting. I use a psychological approach designed by creating consumer insight hypotheses based on in-depth interviews, which are then verified by webmotivation research and text-mining. This innovative sales promotion approach is a very hot topic as a new type of promotion development among large companies in Japan and is useful in avoiding pricediscounting sales. This paper explains the concrete process used in this type of promotion and reveals the successful case of a large spice company in Japan. The process uses price sensitivity measurement (PSM) as a pricing technique. In the experiment, conducted in nine retail stores, the most successful sales promotion condition saw an increase of 900% in monetary sales without price discounting during the two weeks of the experiment, and 500% in the two weeks after that. © 2012 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;1;1;NA;2012;Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous) | Marketing;11;Advances in Business Marketing and Purchasing

However, CGM are almost always accompanied by traditional media (such as TV advertising). This research addresses the critical question of whether new and traditional media reinforce or damage one another's effectiveness. This question is important because traditional media, in which a manufacturer creates and delivers content to consumers, consume a firm's resources. In contrast to these paid media, new media (in which consumers create content and this content is exchanged between other consumers and potentially between manufacturers) are primarily available for free. This question becomes even more salient when new product launches are involved, as firms typically allocate approximately half of their marketing budgets to support new products.One of the most prevalent forms of new media is blogging. Therefore, we assemble a unique data set from Japan that contains market outcomes (sales) for new products, new media (blogs) and traditional media (TV advertising) in the movie category. We specify a simultaneous equation log-linear system for market outcomes and the volume of blogs. Our results suggest that new and traditional media act synergistically, that pre-launch TV advertising spurs blogging activity but becomes less effective during the post-launch period and that market outcomes have an effect on blogging quantity. We find detailed support for some of these results via a unique and novel text-mining analysis and replicate our findings for a second product category, cellular phone service.

Stern School of Business;New York;United States;Designing ranking systems for hotels on travel search engines by mining user-generated and crowdsourced content;Marketing Science;"User-generated content on social media platforms and product search engines is changing the way consumers shop for goods online. However, current product search engines fail to effectively leverage information created across diverse social media platforms. Moreover, current ranking algorithms in these product search engines tend to induce consumers to focus on one single product characteristic dimension (e.g., price, star rating). This approach largely ignores consumers' multidimensional preferences for products. In this paper, we propose to generate a ranking system that recommends products that provide, on average, the best value for the consumer's money. The key idea is that products that provide a higher surplus should be ranked higher on the screen in response to consumer queries. We use a unique data set of U.S. hotel reservations made over a three-month period through Travelocity, which we supplement with data from various social media sources using techniques from text mining, image classification, social geotagging, human annotations, and geomapping. We propose a random coefficient hybrid structural model, taking into consideration the two sources of consumer heterogeneity the different travel occasions and different hotel characteristics introduce. Based on the estimates from the model, we infer the economic impact of various location and service characteristics of hotels. We then propose a new hotel ranking system based on the average utility gain a consumer receives from staying in a particular hotel. By doing so, we can provide customers with the ""best-value"" hotels early on. Our user studies, using ranking comparisons from several thousand users, validate the superiority of our ranking system relative to existing systems on several travel search engines. On a broader note, this paper illustrates how social media can be mined and incorporated into a demand estimation model in order to generate a new ranking system in product search engines.

First, we discuss data fusion, merging of proprietary databases with market research data, which enables appending attitudinal data to customer behaviour. Secondly, best practices in direct marketing leverage analysis of customer response patterns to provide the right offer to the right customer at the right moment. Thirdly, analysing internet usage data allows many opportunities for small-scale, agile marketing pilots. And finally, social media are discussed, one of the newer opportunities to collect data about customer sentiments that relies heavily on text mining analytics. © 2011 MacMillan Publishers Ltd.;18;1;data analytics | data fusion | direct marketing | internet usage | social media | text mining;2011;Business and International Management | Marketing | Management of Technology and Innovation;29;Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice

Classic challenges in marketing such as pricing, campaign management, brand positioning, and new product development are rooted in an analysis of product substitutes and complements inferred from market structure. In this article, the authors present a method to support the analysis and visualization of market structure by automatically eliciting product attributes and brand's relative positions from online customer reviews. First, the method uncovers attributes and attribute dimensions using the ""voice of the consumer,"" as reflected in customer reviews, rather than that of manufacturers. Second, the approach runs automatically. Third, the process supports rather than supplants managerial judgment by reinforcing or augmenting attributes and dimensions found through traditional surveys and focus groups. The authors test the approach on six years of customer reviews for digital cameras during a period of rapid market evolution. They analyze and visualize results in several ways, including comparisons with expert buying guides, a laboratory survey, and correspondence analysis of automatically discovered product attributes. The authors evaluate managerial insights drawn from the analysis with respect to proprietary market research reports from the same period analyzing digital imaging products. © 2011, American Marketing Association.";320;2;Market structure analysis | Online customer reviews | Text mining;2011;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;59;Journal of Marketing Research

In this article, the authors present a method to support the analysis and visualization of market structure by automatically eliciting product attributes and brand's relative positions from online customer reviews. First, the method uncovers attributes and attribute dimensions using the ""voice of the consumer,"" as reflected in customer reviews, rather than that of manufacturers. Second, the approach runs automatically. Third, the process supports rather than supplants managerial judgment by reinforcing or augmenting attributes and dimensions found through traditional surveys and focus groups. The authors test the approach on six years of customer reviews for digital cameras during a period of rapid market evolution. They analyze and visualize results in several ways, including comparisons with expert buying guides, a laboratory survey, and correspondence analysis of automatically discovered product attributes. The authors evaluate managerial insights drawn from the analysis with respect to proprietary market research reports from the same period analyzing digital imaging products. © 2011, American Marketing Association.";320;2;Market structure analysis | Online customer reviews | Text mining;2011;Business and International Management | Economics and Econometrics | Marketing;59;Journal of Marketing Research

The pros and cons expressed in this way uncover individually perceived strengths and weaknesses of the respective products, whereas the usually assigned product ratings represent their overall valuation. The key question at this point is how to turn the available plentitude of individual consumer opinions into aggregate consumer preferences, which can be used, for example, in product development or improvement processes. To solve this problem, an econometric framework is presented that can be applied to the mentioned type of data after having prepared it using natural language processing techniques. The suggested methodology enables the estimation of parameters, which allow inferences on the relative effect of product attributes and brand names on the overall evaluation of the products. Specifically, we discuss options for taking opinion heterogeneity into account. Both the practicability and the benefits of the suggested approach are demonstrated using product review data from the mobile phone market. This paper demonstrates that the review-based results compare very favorably with consumer preferences obtained through conjoint analysis techniques. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.;259;2;Consumer behavior | Electronic commerce and internet marketing | Market analysis and response | Preference analysis | Product management | User generated content;2010;Marketing;81;International Journal of Research in Marketing

462;7005388652;Leventhal B.;Leventhal;BarryAnalytics Ltd;Borehamwood;United Kingdom;An introduction to data mining and other techniques for advanced analytics;Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice;This paper reviews the use of data mining (DM) for extracting patterns from large databases, held by companies such as banks, retailers and telco operators. The DM process is discussed, together with the ideal architecture, for applying this approach in a data warehouse environment. Some related techniques are identified advanced data visualization tools for converting large volumes of data into pictorial form together with text mining and social network analysis for extracting structured data from unstructured text and relationships. The role of contact optimization is highlighted, as a method for optimizing the business value that a company can achieve from its DM activities. Finally, the paper suggests some initial steps in selecting a DM software product and offers the author's personal guidelines for the types of product that are likely to be most useful in different situations. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.;19;1;advanced analytics | contact optimization | data mining | data visualization | social network analysis | text mining;2010;Business and International Management | Marketing | Management of Technology and Innovation;10;Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice

Given how hard it is to differentiate the product’s more objective dimensions, it is important to understand the emotions and feelings that accompany wine purchasing, consuming or sharing experiences. The present study uses a writing workshop and literature review to uncover the relationships between the dimensions of the emotions that people feel during an experience of this kind, along with the mode of expression of different consumer groups. It also offers specific analysis of the role played by brands among the different characteristics of emotions. Towards this end, a series of wine-related experiential narratives has been compiled and treated via a structural text analysis approach followed by lexical contents analysis. One of the findings breaks consumers’ involvement down into four categories of emotions. Another comes from a content analysis of the narratives that will differentiate among three separate consumer groups. Lastly, suggestions will be made in terms of wider consequences for the field of wine marketing. © The Authors.

It is a form of guided introspection that seeks to develop finely grained first-person accounts by using distinctions in language, internal sensory representations and imagery that have been incorporated from neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). It is also a participative, relational and developmental form of interviewing, in the sense that the interviewee can gain significant insight into their experience; the process is not concerned purely with data gathering. Design/methodology/approach – The authors review the theoretical assumptions on which psychophenomenology is based, then describe the principal method used in psychophenomenology, the “explicitation interview”. The interview protocol is illustrated with transcript data, through which they identify specific aspects of NLP that have been incorporated into psychophenomenology. Findings – Psychophenomenology offers refinements to the precision of phenomenological methods found in organizational research, such as interpretative phenomenological analysis. Research limitations/implications – The epistemological claims and implications of psychophenomenology are reviewed. Practical implications – These developments may provide a basis for reconsidering the research value of introspection, which has often been dismissed as non-rigorous. Originality/value – The paper introduces psychophenomenology to the field of organizational research. It also describes how psychophenomenology has innovated by drawing from NLP, an approach to personal development that is found in organizational practices such as executive coaching, in order to enhance the precision and rigour of both interviews and transcript analysis.";10;2;Interviews | Neurolinguistic programming | Phenomenology | Qualitative research;2010;Business and International Management | Strategy and Management | Marketing;60;Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics

Design/methodology/approach - The current methods of forecasting cannot keep pace with the changing dynamics of the marketplace - mostly due to the rampant diffusion of data/information. The company that can tap the continual flow of data/information in the present, contrast it with a stored set of information from the past, and adjust based on repeated cycles, will have the best insight into the lingering trend, changing trend, or dynamic trend. The paper uses a simple example to explain blog trend analysis using Nielsen BuzzMetrics' BlogPulse. Findings - The study finds that to make fashion weblog forecasting a reality, there needs to be a rich accumulation of fashion communication in structured blogs. In addition, there needs to be a classification of the various forms of industry web text, web venue. Furthermore, rich research traditions must be in place to chronicle the cultural, behavioral, linguistic, socioeconomic, and communication behaviors over time for the weblog and the fashion weblogger in particular. Practical implications - The changing dynamics of the fashion business makes it a good example for understanding the weblog-text mining approach developed in this paper.

Design/methodology/approach - A web survey using a critical incident technique approach (CIT) and follow-up interviews was used to sequentially capture verbal accounts of the very first experience of users of a particular internet bank. Text analyses were carried out from the complete set of responses to the trigger questions to synthesise user accounts of these experiences. Findings - These verbal syntheses (as modelled by a Pertex text-analytic approach) are purported to illustrate e-competence. A diverging pattern of e-competency was found. One group of customers was able to handle the web site and the other group felt abandoned and was not able to adopt technology. Research limitations/implications - The study comprised a limited sample of Danish first-time internet bank customers. Therefore, generalisations should not be drawn as to the competencies of bank customers. Further research could encompass much larger and broader samples and be focused on a particular internet function or e-service. Practical implications - Findings suggest that some customer groups may have difficulties in applying new technology and that these groups may have special needs of support in the start-up period. Originality/value - The value of the paper is that it illustrates a new kind of text analysis that can summarise divergent texts and thereby distinguish between different kinds of user competence in a meaningful way. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;14;2;Banking | Competences | Worldwide web;2005;Marketing;28;International Journal of Bank Marketing

475;7005227018;Pitt L.;Pitt;Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam;Rotterdam;Netherlands;Analysing competitors' online persuasive themes with text mining;"Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning";Information is power. Cliché, but true. The Internet has simultaneously empowered individuals. Prospects can click, choose and control their online interactions. For organisations, the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction. They face more competition and are overloaded with more information than ever before.

476;8361932300;Sinkovics R.R.;Sinkovics;Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien;Vienna;Austria;National differences in materialism using alternative research strategies to explore the construct;Journal of International Consumer Marketing;One of the core objectives in cross-national marketing research is to establish research results which are comparable across national entities. Nevertheless, certain national idiosyncrasies (unique meaning of constructs, distinctive expressions) may hamper these cross-national research endeavors. Two different approaches have been introduced in the social sciences, in order to cope with this comparability-dilemma. The “emic” and the “etic” school of thought. These can be seen as two extremes on the continuum of cross-national research methodology. The paper tries to illustrate advantages and potential shortcomings of the etic (mostly quantitative) vs. the emic (mostly qualitative) research approach. A combination of alternative, qualitative and quantitative research strategies was used to explore national differences in materialism. A questionnaire was developed comprising both qualitative and quantitative sections on materialism. The materialism scale, as operationalized by Richins and Dawson (1992), was used for the quantitative section. The research findings call for the use of alternative research strategies” to overcome the emic/etic duality in cross-national research. Comparative text analysis and graphical representations of consumers’ statements can help to explore the reasons for conceptual differences. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Relevant literature from the fields of social psychology, applied psychology and marketing are reviewed and a programme of research was carried out, comprising an Omnibus to measure the extent of telemarketing experience in the UK population and a study among organisations with in-house telemarketing facilities to explore the types of practices that might foster rapport. It concludes that a telemarketing culture still has some way to develop and that, while many organisations used a number of seemingly relevant techniques, in particular NLP mirroring and matching, there are a number of issues still to be resolved regarding measurement of rapport as well as the theory and “measuring instruments” associated with NLP. Other factors affecting the development of rapport in a telemarketing environment are also considered. © 1998, MCB UP Limited;11;2;Direct marketing | Market segmentation | Marketing communications | Psychology | Telecommunications industry | Telemarketing;1998;Marketing;30;"Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning"

Explores the use of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) and projective techniques in quantitative research. Reports the results of customizing a self-completion questionnaire to a respondent’s preferred representational system (PRS). This application of NLP produced encouraging findings. Provides suggestions for further research. Describes an example of how NLP and projective techniques can benefit a quantitative study with a case study in which TRBI’s BrandWorks was used. Suggests that, although the adoption by qualitative researchers of techniques used in quantitative research focuses on computer applications, the recent academic interest in the use of text analysers has not been matched by practitioners. Discusses issues related to quality, validity, transparency and value, and reports the findings of a survey of the largest qualitative marketing research suppliers. Finally, examines the use of correspondence analysis and describes ways in which correspondence analysis might benefit the qualitative researcher. © 1996, MCB UP Limited;5;3;Computer management | Neuro-linguistic programming | Qualitative techniques | Quantitative techniques;1996;Marketing;26;"Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning"
