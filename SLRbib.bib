Dans quelle mesure nos décisions d'achat sont-elles rationnelles? Peut-on les influencer? Comment? Les commerces doivent aujourd'hui composer avec un consommateur à la fois pressé, stressé, ultra-sollicité par les marques mais aussi surinformé. Y a-t-il de vrais moyens de capter son attention? Dans un monde où le temps de décision d'achat est de plus en plus réduit, les neurosciences, ainsi que la " behaviorial economics " (économie comportementale et sciences de la décision), annoncent une ère nouvelle pour le marketing. Elles permettent à la fois de comprendre les processus de décision et d'orienter le comportement du consommateur. Ce livre permet de comprendre comment les utiliser pour lancer de nouveaux produits, proposer des packaging, communiquer, innover, concevoir son merchandising.},

Science is a process involving the interaction between empirical generalizations and theory. An empirical generalization is ?a pattern or regularity that repeats over different circumstances and that can be described simply by mathematical, graphic, or symbolic methods.? One of the purposes of the Empirical Generalizations Conference held at Wharton on February 16?18, 1994 was to develop a list of examples of such empirical generalizations in marketing. Empirical generalization can precede a theory to explain it or it can be predicted by a theory. Science is the process of interaction between theory and data that leads to higher level theories. Examples are provided here of empirical generalizations in marketing and their theoretical counterparts. One example is provided of a higher level theory.},

	abstract = {Consumers’ postpurchase evaluations have received much attention due to the strong link between ratings and sales. However, less is known about how herding effects from reference groups (i.e., crowd and friends) unfold in online ratings. This research examines the role of divergent opinions, rater experience, and firm product portfolio in attenuating/amplifying herding influences in online rating environments. Applying robust econometric techniques on data from a community of board gamers, we find that herding effects are significant and recommend a more nuanced view of herding. Highlighting the role of rater experience, the positive influence of the crowd is weakened and friend influences are amplified as the rater gains experience. Furthermore, divergent opinions between reference groups create herding and differentiation depending on the reference group and the rater’s experience level. Finally, firms can influence online opinion through their product portfolio in profound ways. A broad and deep product portfolio not only leads to favorable quality inferences but also attenuates social influence. Implications for online reputation management, rating system design, and firm product strategy are discussed.},

The R package {cleanNLP}, which calls one of two state of the art {NLP} libraries ({CoreNLP} or {spaCy}), is presented as an implementation of this data model. It takes raw text as an input and returns a list of normalized tables. Speciﬁc annotations provided include tokenization, part of speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, and word embeddings. The package currently supports input text in English, German, French, and Spanish.},

	abstract = {This paper critically examines emergent research with sentiment analysis tools to assess their current status and relevance to applied opinion and behaviour measurement. The rapid spread of online news and online chatter in blogs, micro-blogs and social media sites has created a potentially rich source of public opinion. Waves of public feeling are vented spontaneously on a wide range of issues on a minute-by-minute basis in the online world. These online discourses are continually being refreshed, and businesses and advertisers, governments and policy makers have woken up to the fact that this universe of self-perpetuating human sentiment could represent a valuable resource to guide political and business decisions. The massive size of this repository of emotional content renders manual analysis of it feasible only for tiny portions of its totality, and even then can be labour intensive. Computer scientists have however produced software tools that can apply linguistic rules to provide electronic readings of meanings and emotions. These tools are now being utilised by applied social science and market researchers to yield sentiment profiles from online discourses created within specific platforms that purport to represent reliable substitutes for more traditional, offline measures of public opinion. This paper considers what these tools have demonstrated so far and where caution in their application is still called for.},

Cette nouvelle forme d'externalisation n'a cessé d'évoluer en s'amplifiant et en se diversifiant pour, par exemple, donner naissance au crowdfunding ou au crowdtesting. A la différence d'une externalisation classique, le crowdsourcing bénéficie de la synergie entre la foule et les technologies Internet, ce qui lui confère des potentialités immenses. Se fondant à la fois sur des approches théoriques en management et sur des exemples concrets, cet ouvrage présente en détail onze types distincts d'opérations de crowdsourcing. Il montre comment cette nouvelle externalisation peut être utilisée pour créer de la valeur et de nouvelles opportunités pour les entreprises. Pour en mesurer les effets, une analyse présente un modèle original qui lie types de valeur, types de foule, motivations et incitations. Les aspects critiques du crowdsourcing, son éthique et son avenir sont discutés avec notamment une ouverture sur les synergies potentiellement importantes entre crowdsourcing, impression 3D et monnaie virtuelle."},

	abstract = {Different models have been proposed for disaster management by researchers and agencies. Despite their efficiency in some locations, disasters are still a fundamental challenge in the way of sustainable development. The purpose of this research is developing a comprehensive conceptual model for disaster management using thematic analysis. In this regard, first, disaster management models are collected. In the next stage, the themes of each model are extracted and categorised in three phases. In the first phase that is descriptive coding, available elements in each model are extracted as code and the basic themes are recognised. Then, in the phase of interpretive coding, basic themes are classified in three categories that are called organising themes (i.e. hazard assessment, risk management and management actions). In the final phase, strategic management is selected as the global or overarching theme to integrate all the other themes. Based on thematic analysis, it can be concluded that disaster management has three main elements that are the three organising themes. Therefore, comprehensive model of disaster management should include these three elements and their sub-basic themes that is called the ideal or criterion type. Results showed that some scientists have looked at disaster management one dimensionally (one theme). Even in two-dimensional models, one dimension has advantage over the other one. While the proposed typology in this study showed that the comprehensive model should include all the three mentioned elements.},

            The amount of digital text available for analysis by consumer researchers has risen dramatically. Consumer discussions on the internet, product reviews, and digital archives of news articles and press releases are just a few potential sources for insights about consumer attitudes, interaction, and culture. Drawing from linguistic theory and methods, this article presents an overview of automated text analysis, providing integration of linguistic theory with constructs commonly used in consumer research, guidance for choosing amongst methods, and advice for resolving sampling and statistical issues unique to text analysis. We argue that although automated text analysis cannot be used to study all phenomena, it is a useful tool for examining patterns in text that neither researchers nor consumers can detect unaided. Text analysis can be used to examine psychological and sociological constructs in consumer-produced digital text by enabling discovery or by providing ecological validity.},

However, in many applications of these models, the collection grows over time, making it infeasible to run batch algorithms repeatedly. This problem can be addressed by using online algorithms, which update estimates of the topics as each document is observed. We introduce two related Rao-Blackwellized online inference algorithms for the latent Dirichlet allocation ({LDA}) model – incremental Gibbs samplers and particle filters – and compare their runtime and performance to that of existing algorithms.},

The results show that the median standard of living and the education level are the main determinants of the general participation, whereas some specific variables explain the participation of each of the four topics.},

Largely automated, natural language processing techniques sequence a series of operations from the constitution of the corpus to its annotation, resulting in representation and qualification models. These methods are now widely available through the r and python language libraries. They make it possible to exploit the large corpus that digitisation makes it possible to build: consumer comments, news bases, activity reports, interview reports. The purpose of this text is essentially technical, however without giving any operating method. It indicates generic methods that can be used via r and their context of use. This is a short manual of modern textual analysis. For business research.},

After a presentation of the intellectual project, as an inductive approach to language based on the exploration of corpora, we present the principles of correspondence analysis, which is the main method developed in the Data Analysis School, used for corpus analysis but also for many other types of datasets. Then, we will focus on textual data analysis. Based on the fact that software programmes have played a major role in the use of these statistical techniques, we shall examine a selection of these, display their specificities and their underlying theoretical bases.},

Then we address the problem of solving {NMF}, which is {NP}-hard in general. We review some standard {NMF} algorithms, and also present a recent subclass of {NMF} problems, referred to as near-separable {NMF}, that can be solved eﬃciently (that is, in polynomial time), even in the presence of noise –this is the how. Finally, we brieﬂy describe some problems in mathematics and computer science closely related to {NMF} via the nonnegative rank.},

	abstract = {Social media is becoming popular for news consumption due to its fast dissemination, easy access, and low cost. However, it also enables the wide propagation of fake news, i.e., news with intentionally false information. Detecting fake news is an important task, which not only ensures users receive authentic information but also helps maintain a trustworthy news ecosystem. The majority of existing detection algorithms focus on finding clues from news contents, which are generally not effective because fake news is often intentionally written to mislead users by mimicking true news. Therefore, we need to explore auxiliary information to improve detection. The social context during news dissemination process on social media forms the inherent tri-relationship, the relationship among publishers, news pieces, and users, which has potential to improve fake news detection. For example, partisan-biased publishers are more likely to publish fake news, and low-credible users are more likely to share fake news. In this paper, we study the novel problem of exploiting social context for fake news detection. We propose a tri-relationship embedding framework {TriFN}, which models publisher-news relations and user-news interactions simultaneously for fake news classification. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baseline methods for fake news detection.},

Latent Semantic Analysis ({LSA}), a member of a family of methodological approaches that offers an opportunity to address this gap by describing the semantic content in textual data as a set of vectors, was pioneered by researchers in psychology, information retrieval, and bibliometrics. {LSA} involves a matrix operation called singular value decomposition, an extension of principal component analysis. {LSA} generates latent semantic dimensions that are either interpreted, if the researcher’s primary interest lies with the understanding of the thematic structure in the textual data, or used for purposes of clustering, categorisation and predictive modelling, if the interest lies with the conversion of raw text into numerical data, as a precursor to subsequent analysis. This paper reviews five methodological issues that need to be addressed by the researcher who will embark on {LSA}. We examine the dilemmas, present the choices, and discuss the considerations under which good methodological decisions are made. We illustrate these issues with the help of four small studies, involving the analysis of abstracts for papers published in the European Journal of Information Systems.},

The main difficulty in the application of genetic algorithms ({GAs}) for document clustering is thousands or even tens of thousands of dimensions in feature space which is typical for textual data. Because the most straightforward and popular approach represents texts with the vector space model ({VSM}), that is, each unique term in the vocabulary represents one dimension. Latent semantic indexing ({LSI}) is a successful technology in information retrieval which attempts to explore the latent semantics implied by a query or a document through representing them in a dimension-reduced space. Meanwhile, {LSI} takes into account the effects of synonymy and polysemy, which constructs a semantic structure in textual data. {GA} belongs to search techniques that can efficiently evolve the optimal solution in the reduced space. We propose a variable string length genetic algorithm which has been exploited for automatically evolving the proper number of clusters as well as providing near optimal data set clustering. {GA} can be used in conjunction with the reduced latent semantic structure and improve clustering efficiency and accuracy. The superiority of {GAL} approach over conventional {GA} applied in {VSM} model is demonstrated by providing good Reuter document clustering results.},

	abstract = {Text clustering is arguably one of the most important topics in modern data mining. Nevertheless, text data require tokenization which usually yields a very large and highly sparse term-document matrix, which is usually diﬃcult to process using conventional machine learning algorithms. Methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis have helped mitigate this issue, but are nevertheless not completely stable in practice. As a result, we propose a new feature agglomeration method based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, which is employed to separate the terms into groups, and then each group’s term vectors are agglomerated into a new feature vector. Together, these feature vectors create a new feature space much more suitable for clustering. In addition, we propose a new deterministic initialization for spherical K-Means, which proves very useful for this speciﬁc type of data. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we compare it to some of the latest research done in this ﬁeld, as well as some of the most practiced methods. In our experiments, we conclude that the proposed method either signiﬁcantly improves clustering performance, or maintains the performance of other methods, while improving stability in results.},

Instead of minimizing the common Euclidean Distance ({EucD}) error, we review an alternative method that maximizes the correntropy similarity measure to produce the factorization. Correntropy is an entropy-based criterion defined as a nonlinear similarity measure. Following the discussion of maximization of the correntropy function, we use it to cluster document data set and compare the clustering performance with the {EucD}-based {NMF}. Our approach was applied and illustrated for the clustering of documents in the 20-Newsgroups data set. The comparison is illustrated with 20-Newsgroups data set. The results show that our approach produces per average better clustering compared with other methods which use {EucD} as an objective function.},

	abstract = {The identification of geographic target markets is critical to the success of companies that are expanding internationally. Country borders have traditionally been used to delineate such target markets, resulting in accessible segments and cost efficient entry strategies. However, at present such "countries-as-segments" strategies may no longer be valid. In response to the accelerating trend toward global market convergence and within-country fragmentation of consumer needs, cross-national consumer segmentation is increasingly used, in which consumers in different countries are grouped based on the similarities in their needs, ignoring the country borders. In this paper, we propose new methodology that helps to improve the identification of spatial segments by using information on the location of consumers. Our methodology identifies spatial segments based on consumer needs and at the same time uses spatial information at the subcountry level. We suggest that segments of consumers are likely to demonstrate spatial patterns and develop a hierarchical Bayes approach specifying several types of spatial dependence. Rather than assigning consumers to segments, we identify spatial segments consisting of predefined regions. We develop four models specifying different types of spatial dependence. Two models characterize situations of spatial independence and countries-as-segments, which represent existing approaches to intemational segmentation. The other two models accommodate spatial association within and spatial contiguity of segments and are new to the segmentation literature. The models account for within-segment heterogeneity in multiattribute-based segmentation, covering numerous applications in response-based market segmentation. We show that the models can be estimated using Gibbs sampling, where for the spatial contiguity model, a rejection sampling procedure is proposed.

The identification of geographic target markets is critical to the success of companies that are expanding internationally. Country borders have traditionally been used to delineate such target markets, resulting in accessible segments and cost efficient entry strategies. However, at present such "countries-as-segments" strategies may no longer be valid. In response to the accelerating trend toward global market convergence and within-country fragmentation of consumer needs, cross-national consumer segmentation is increasingly used, in which consumers in different countries are grouped based on the similarities in their needs, ignoring the country borders. In this paper, we propose new methodology that helps to improve the identification of spatial segments by using information on the location of consumers. Our methodology identifies spatial segments based on consumer needs and at the same time uses spatial information at the subcountry level. We suggest that segments of consumers are likely to demonstrate spatial patterns and develop a hierarchical Bayes approach specifying several types of spatial dependence. Rather than assigning consumers to segments, we identify spatial segments consisting of predefined regions. We develop four models specifying different types of spatial dependence. Two models characterize situations of spatial independence and countries-as-segments, which represent existing approaches to intemational segmentation. The other two models accommodate spatial association within and spatial contiguity of segments and are new to the segmentation literature. The models account for within-segment heterogeneity in multiattribute-based segmentation, covering numerous applications in response-based market segmentation. We show that the models can be estimated using Gibbs sampling, where for the spatial contiguity model, a rejection sampling procedure is proposed. We conduct an analysis of synthetic data to assess the performance of the most... {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of Marketing Science is the property of {INFORMS}: Institute for Operations Research and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Here, we investigate this important question: Does a firm's relationship marketing truly pay off by enhancing financial outcomes? We examine the effects of relationship marketing on a buyer's concurrent person-to-firm relationship with the selling firm and his/her interpersonal relationship with the salesperson. Drawing on social judgment and attribution theories, we offer and test a theoretical model explicating (1) how a seller's social, structural, and financial relationship marketing programs affect buyer relationship quality with the salesperson and the selling firm and (2) how those relationship qualities ultimately generate seller financial outcomes. Relationship marketing programs indeed build buyer relationship quality, but whether those relationship-building effects reside with the salesperson or the selling firm depends on buyer perceptions regarding salesperson versus selling firm control of those programs. Buyer relationship quality with both salesperson and selling firm positively affect seller financial outcomes, but the effect of relationship quality with the selling firm is enhanced as perceived selling firm consistency increases. Employing triadic data from matched buyer, salesperson, and sales manager, this research presents an end-to-end empirical examination of how a seller's relationship marketing affects its financial outcomes through the buyer's relationships with the salesperson and selling firm.},

Although market orientation has been considered one of those critical resources, there is little understanding regarding how it is created and nurtured in business relationships. In the context of asymmetrical channel partnerships dominated by a downstream leader, in this paper we present a model where the upstream follower's market orientation is promoted as a consequence of the leader's use of authoritative mechanisms of coordination. Some hypotheses are presented and empirically tested in a sample of agricultural cooperatives that maintain channel partnerships with second-order marketing cooperatives. The results indicate that formalization, participation, input control, and behaviour control are coordination mechanisms that lead to improvements in market orientation. Implications for interorganisational theory and managerial activities are discussed at the end of the paper.},

Both the college student and the working adult versions aim to capture the major elements of intrinsic motivation (self-determination, competence, task involvement, curiosity, enjoyment, and interest) and extrinsic motivation (concerns with competition, evaluation, recognition, money or other tangible incentives, and constraint by others). The instrument is scored on two primary scales, each subdivided into 2 secondary scales. The {WPI} has meaningful factor structures, adequate internal consistency, good short-term test-retest reliability, and good longer term stability. Moreover, {WPI} scores are related in meaningful ways to other questionnaire and behavioral measures of motivation, as well as personality characteristics, attitudes, and behaviors. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of Journal of Personality \& Social Psychology is the property of American Psychological Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

	abstract = {The authors present a unified strategic framework that enables competing marketing strategy options to be traded off on the basis of projected financial return, which is operationalized as the change in a firm's customer equity relative to the incremental expenditure necessary to produce the change. The change in the firm's customer equity is the change in its current and future customers' lifetime values, summed across all customers in the industry. Each customer's lifetime value results from the frequency of category purchases, average quantity of purchase, and brand-switching patterns combined with the firm's contribution margin. The brand-switching matrix can be estimated from either longitudinal panel data or cross-sectional survey data, using a logit choice model. Firms can analyze drivers that have the greatest impact, compare the drivers' performance with that of competitors' drivers, and project return on investment from improvements in the drivers. To demonstrate how the approach can be implemented in a specific corporate setting and to show the methods used to test and validate the model, the authors illustrate a detailed application of the approach by using data from the airline industry. Their framework enables what-if evaluation of marketing return on investment, which can include such criteria as return on quality, return on advertising, return on loyalty programs, and even return on corporate citizenship, given a particular shift in customer perceptions. This enables the firm to focus marketing efforts on strategic initiatives that generate the greatest return. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of Journal of Marketing is the property of American Marketing Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

The authors present a unified strategic framework that enables competing marketing strategy options to be traded off on the basis of projected financial return, which is operationalized as the change in a firm's customer equity relative to the incremental expenditure necessary to produce the change. The change in the firm's customer equity is the change in its current and future customers' lifetime values, summed across all customers in the industry. Each customer's lifetime value results from the frequency of category purchases, average quantity of purchase, and brand-switching patterns combined with the firm's contribution margin. The brand-switching matrix can be estimated from either longitudinal panel data or cross-sectional survey data, using a logit choice model. Firms can analyze drivers that have the greatest impact, compare the drivers' performance with that of competitors' drivers, and project return on investment from improvements in the drivers. To demonstrate how the approach can be implemented in a specific corporate setting and to show the methods used to test and validate the model, the authors illustrate a detailed application of the approach by using data from the airline industry. Their framework enables what-if evaluation of marketing return on investment, which can include such criteria as return on quality, return on advertising, return on loyalty programs, and even return on corporate citizenship, given a particular shift in customer perceptions. This enables the firm to focus marketing efforts on strategic initiatives that generate the greatest return. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of Journal of Marketing is the property of American Marketing Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

We illustrate and evaluate applications of nonparametric scaling to a Dutch data set containing information on ownership of nine financial products by 1361 households in 2001. Results show that use of nonparametric scaling reveals acquisition patterns of financial products. Because the analyzed data set also contains information on actual acquisition dates, we can show the deduced acquisition patterns have high forecasting accuracy in terms of future acquisitions. Results can be further improved by taking into consideration market dynamics, such as changes of product positions in acquisition patterns.},

Study 1 examines the psychological mechanism consumers use when a country image is decomposed into component and assembly origins. Study 2 extends the effect of decomposing country image to the context of global brands and product experience. It was found that subjects do not seem to differ either in the psychological mechanism they use or in their confidence in evaluating a product which is "made in" a country versus a product which has its "components from" and "is assembled in" the same country. As hypothesized, the effect of country image was weakened when it was decomposed. A strong positive brand was found to override negative assembly origin effect.

We also modify the {BG}/{NBD} model to incorporate zero repeat purchasers. All models capture the main characteristics of the purchase and dropout process of individual customers and produce similar forecasts.

The authors maintain that, under conditions of multi- collinearity, the Equity estimator provides estimates that are typically closer to the true parameters than the ordinary least squares and Ridge estimates. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of Journal of Marketing Research ({JMR}) is the property of American Marketing Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

	abstract = {Internet shopping is overwhelmingly predicted to grow although opinion differs on the pace of growth. Growth is anticipated particularly for those countries with a large number of Internet users. One reason for this prediction of growth is the assertion that the Internet is an internationalised product or idea that appeals to a cross-national consumer segment who possess common personal characteristics and exhibit similar Internet shopping behaviour. This article explores this assertion. The article integrates the two conventional approaches to Internet consumer research, i.e. within-country analysis and between-country analysis, to search for a cross-national consumer segment group. Britain and Taiwan are selected for conducting this cross-national study. National survey data sets collected for each of the two countries are used. Intra-country analysis shows that demographic structures of Internet shoppers respectively in Britain and Taiwan are quite different. Internet shoppers can be segmented more clearly by gender and age in Britain than in Taiwan. On the other hand, occupation, income and region of residence are more influential in the `digital shopping divide' in Taiwan than in Britain. The inter-country analysis indicates that a higher proportion of the population made online purchase in Britain than in Taiwan. Across six demographic variables and one country variable used for the pan-country analysis, it is found that only the country variable is significant at 99 per cent confidence level. This suggests that, on the basis of demographics, between-country difference is more influential than within-country difference.

Design/methodology/approach — The conceptual discussion aims to assist future progress of relationship marketing and, more generally, marketing theory. While focusing on specific areas of departures and inadequacies in past and current research in the area, the discussion notes seminal philosophical questions which underpin current marketing sensibilities and which inform the nature of relational discourses. Findings — It is argued that, in spite of recent developments in and maturation of relational discourses, some research in the field remains rather non-contingent, theoretical and not observation-informed. Importantly, it is biased towards the discussion of positive aspects of relationships. Matters of consequence to practice and research such as power and disciplining remain under-researched. Research limitations/implications — By deconstructing and reconstructing current relationship marketing theory — partly by using a study of power and disciplining in situations of consumer dissatisfaction — ways of confronting shortcomings of relational research are illustrated. A more balanced and nuanced approach to marketing research and practice is proposed. Originality/value — This is one of the few papers in marketing research, and relationship-marketing research in particular, conceptually intrigued by the peculiarities of current thinking of relationships and exchanges. The contribution centres on three observations and a number of suggestions for future relational analysis. The discussion aims to help promote a fuller, deeper understanding of exchanges.

The contribution centres on three observations and a number of suggestions for future relational analysis. The discussion aims to help promote a fuller, deeper understanding of exchanges. It has been designed as a sketchy guide to future relationship marketing research. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of European Journal of Marketing is the property of Emerald and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

	abstract = {Recessions can severely affect the performance of firms, and even their very survival. However, all firms are not equally affected by a recession. Some firms view recessions as opportunities to strengthen their businesses, invest aggressively and establish their advantage over their weaker competitors, whereas others cut back, waiting for the recession to pass. Why do some firms view the recession as an opportunity and develop an aggressive marketing response to it? What are the effects of such a marketing response on the performance of the firm? These are the two central questions we address in this paper. We propose a new construct, which we call proactive marketing in a recession, as the firm's interpretation of the recession as an opportunity (opportunity interpretation) and development and execution of a response to capitalize on the perceived opportunity created by the change (offensive response). We develop and test a model of the antecedents and consequences of proactive marketing during a recession. The results of a survey of 154 senior marketing executives show that some firms do indeed adopt proactive marketing during a recession. Both organizational and environmental contexts influence firms' proactive response to a recession. Firms that have a strategic emphasis on marketing, an entrepreneurial culture, and slack resources are proactive in their marketing activities during a recession, while the severity of the recession in the industry negatively affects proactive marketing response. In addition, firms that have a proactive marketing response in a recession achieve superior business performance even during the recession. Our results suggest that not all firms do, or should, respond in a proactive manner during a recession. Those firms with a strategic emphasis on marketing already have programs in place (e.g., well-recognized brands, differentiated products, targeted communications, good support and service, etc.) that enable them to derive benefits from a proactive marketing response during the recession.},

Seeks to identify the sources of the influence of the alliance partners which induce changes in the attitude and behaviour of cardholders. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model was developed to reveal the impact of perceived card benefits, affective customer loyalty toward the bank, affective customer loyalty toward the affinity organisation, and perceived prestige of affinity organisation, on the card usage behaviours of customers. Survey data were obtained from 162 students who were holders of a university affinity credit card in Hong Kong. Findings - Findings indicated two routes of influence that affect the intention and behaviours of affinity credit cardholders. The two routes were complementary rather than competitive in a symbiotic collaboration. The first is a cognitive route. It shows that a cardholder's attitude formation is strongly influenced by the cognitive evaluation of card benefits instead of by affective loyalty toward the bank or toward the affinity organisation. The second route is an emotional route of influence. It originates from the perceived prestige of the affinity organisation to cardholders' intention and usage behaviours. Originality/value - The impact of the symbiotic collaboration on customer behaviours is an important question which has yet to be answered in the literature of strategic alliances. To the best of one's knowledge, this is a pioneering empirical study addressing this research issue. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of European Journal of Marketing},

The second route is an emotional route of influence. It originates from the perceived prestige of the affinity organisation to cardholders' intention and usage behaviours. Originality/value - The impact of the symbiotic collaboration on customer behaviours is an important question which has yet to be answered in the literature of strategic alliances. To the best of one's knowledge, this is a pioneering empirical study addressing this research issue. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of European Journal of Marketing is the property of Emerald and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Our findings suggest all three mechanisms are at work in making Internet Search={\textgreater}Store Purchase the most popular form of research shopping.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which two components of customer commitment (affective commitment and continuance commitment) both enhance and undermine customer loyalty.

Findings - Commitment serves as a partial mediator of the service quality-loyalty relationship. It was also found that affective commitment made a negative impact on switching intentions and a positive impact on advocacy intentions in all three service settings. Continuance commitment had mixed effects on switching intentions and made a negative impact on advocacy intentions.. At the same time there was an interactive effect between the two components of commitment such that continuance commitment depressed the positive effects of affective commitment on both dependent variables.

A small group brand community is a friendship group of consumers with a shared enthusiasm for the brand and a well-developed social identity, whose members engage jointly in group actions to accomplish collective goals and/or to express mutual sentiments and commitments. Group activities centered on the brand intermingle with other social activities in these brand communities. A comprehensive model is proposed based on a broadening and deepening of the theory of planned behavior to incorporate social intentions, three aspects of social identity (cognitive self-awareness of membership in the brand community, affective commitment, and evaluative significance of membership), anticipated positive and negative emotions toward achieving or failing to achieve group participation goals, and desire as a transformative mechanism translating reasons for acting into social intentions to do so. The proposed theoretical framework is tested on a sample of 154 members of Harley-Davidson Motorcycle small group brand communities and another sample of 255 members of motorcycle riding groups not organized around specific brands.},

Results of moderated regression analysis indicated that, although diversity did not influence participants' perceptions of the aggregate as a single group, diversity did influence intergroup bias. Specifically, bias was highest when more homogeneous groups merged with more diverse groups. The author discussed results in terms of theoretical contributions and implications for managing diversity. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of Journal of Social Psychology is the property of Heldref Publications and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Design/methodology/approach - We interviewed telecom customers that were members of a Swedish telecom company's customer club. The approach was to understand the customer evaluation of the customer club. We conducted 44 in-depth interviews with members of the loyalty club. Findings - We found an umbrella concept for the club regarding loyalty: a keeping function, which divided the customer club in two ways: the affective role makes the customer stay with the company and the calculative role with a more inferred loyalty function. The expressions that were not connected to loyalty is the attracting function. Research imitations/implications - The limitations of our qualitative study include the small sample size, and it represents only one kind of industry and one company. Originality/value - The first contribution of this study is the new perspective of customer clubs in the telecommunications industry on customer relationships. The implication is that customers do not always consider all parts of the club when they stay loyal, and not always think about it when they plan future behaviour. The second contribution is the result regarding re-consideration of the frequency concept. Bearing in mind the delimitations, the calculative role dominated the affective role. Thirty-three of the 44 members said that their club was of minor importance in terms of relationship continuation.

	abstract = {Managers who introduce a new product into the global market must answer critical questions about market size, market responsiveness, and segmentation strategy. Current methods provide a piecemeal approach toward answering these questions. This article provides a new integrated method. The author uses survey-based discrete-choice methodology coupled with latent-class models to identify responsive global segments for a new global satellite-based paging service.

Managers who introduce a new product into the global market must answer critical questions about market size, market responsiveness, and segmentation strategy. Current methods provide a piecemeal approach toward answering these questions. This article provides a new integrated method. The author uses survey-based discrete-choice methodology coupled with latent-class models to identify responsive global segments for a new global satellite-based paging service. The findings reveal seven distinct segments in terms of price responsiveness, size, and market potential. The author shows how these data can be used to develop target segments and marketing strategies. The study adds to the growing literature on international segmentation and pricing. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of Journal of International Marketing is the property of American Marketing Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on Bowen's service typology, responses from patrons of fast-food restaurants and hairdressers/stylists were used to assess the influence of consumer involvement on relationship marketing, specifically perceived service benefits and response behaviors. Findings - Results indicate that highly involved consumers perceive greater relational benefits when engaged in a high contact, customized service (i.e. hairdressers/stylists) versus a more standardized, moderate contact service (i.e. fast-food restaurant). Research limitations/implications - Care should be taken when generalizing these findings to other service settings as this study only addressed two service types. Thus, an opportunity for future research could add moderate contact, non-personalized services to determine if there are significant differences between the three service categories. Additionally, this study was based in the {USA}, thus cultural differences may influence perceived benefits of service firms selected. Practical implications - The results of this study suggest that a service firm providing a more standardized service offering is better served by hiring and training competent and trustworthy employees than by adopting relational benefit programs. On the other hand, high contact customized service providers are encouraged to engage in relationship activities with highly involved consumers, specifically those related to confidence benefits.

In addition, contrary to an alternative explanation based on the notion that higher requirements signal higher value of luxury rewards, the authors show that (1) when the program requirements are held constant but the individual consumer's effort is higher, the shift in preference toward luxuries is still observed and (2) increasing the monetary cost of participating in the {FP} decreases consumer preferences for luxury rewards.

	abstract = {It is now well recognized that an effective service recovery program is essential to generating customer satisfaction and loyalty. A number of studies have investigated the impact of service recovery efforts (compensation, speed of response, etc) on post-recovery satisfaction. However, despite the importance of global markets, none have examined the impact of customers' cultural value orientation (i.e., cultural values measured at the individual level) in implementing effective service recovery programs. In this research we use the individual rather than the nation as the unit of analysis. Using an experimental design with data from both Eastern and Western cultures, we investigate how customer evaluations of recovery efforts are influenced by interplay of consumers' value orientation and service recovery attributes (apology, cognitive control, and recovery initiation). The results reveal that cultural values of individual Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance and Collectivism do indeed interact with a firm's recovery tactics to influence perceptions of fairness (justice). Finally, all three forms of justice (distributive, procedural, interactional) positively impact on overall service recovery satisfaction.},

Findings — A vast majority of study respondents favored immediate, necessary, and monetary gratification. These results were consistent across restaurant types (fast-food versus casual dining). Although savings was the most sought-after benefit, intangible benefits such as quality and convenience also received high ratings. Casual dining customers, in particular, seemed to be highly motivated by exploration and entertainment-type benefits. Research limitations/implications — Future research should investigate the optimal level or combination of rewards. In addition, other types of restaurants (e.g. fine dining) might require different types of reward schemes. Practical implications — The findings of this study suggest that restaurant operators in the casual dining and fast-food segments should consider employing immediate, necessary, and monetary rewards as opposed to points-system, luxury, and non-monetary rewards.

Historically grounding the iconic self-destructing artist as an inheritance from Romanticism, we consider the competing career orientations arising from the contradictory demands for musicians to produce aesthetic experiences for an audience of experts, cognoscenti, or devoted fans while also facing the need to earn cash in the mass market constituted by non-experts.

The authors compare how customer equity is measured and maximized under various approaches. We find that, in the disaggregate-level approach, customer lifetime value is maximized by implementing customer-level strategies such as optimal resource allocation, purchase sequence analysis and balancing acquisition and retention spending. At the aggregate-level, improving the drivers of customer equity maximizes customer equity. A comparison of different aggregate approaches shows that, while an emphasis on retention is a common feature across approaches, conceptual differences in terms of accounting for existing customers and prospects, acquisition, and the projection period exist across the different approaches. The authors propose a hybrid approach, which addresses the issues and challenges in existing approaches and helps firms to measure and manage customer equity. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science is the property of Springer Science \& Business Media B.V. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

The authors compare how customer equity is measured and maximized under various approaches. We find that, in the disaggregate-level approach, customer lifetime value is maximized by implementing customer-level strategies such as optimal resource allocation, purchase sequence analysis and balancing acquisition and retention spending. At the aggregate-level, improving the drivers of customer equity maximizes customer equity. A comparison of different aggregate approaches shows that, while an emphasis on retention is a common feature across approaches, conceptual differences in terms of accounting for existing customers and prospects, acquisition, and the projection period exist across the different approaches. The authors propose a hybrid approach, which addresses the issues and challenges in existing approaches and helps firms to measure and manage customer equity. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science is the property of Springer Science \& Business Media B.V. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

We estimate a fixed effects {VARX} model with dynamic and interactive effects for multiple brands based on pooled time series and cross-sectional data for two product categories. The Impulse Response Analysis ({IRA}) results for one category (tuna) under different scenarios show that the inclusion/exclusion of competitive reaction- and feedback effects matters a lot, consistent with a high degree of competitive interaction in this market. We find that the role of cross-brand feedback effects is greater than the role of traditional competitive reaction effects. Intrafirm effects (internal decisions) also play an important role. In a decomposition study we show that the exclusion of these effects may either increase (up to 12\%) or decrease (by as much as 50\%) the net unit sales effect of a 20\% price reduction. By contrast, in the second category (shampoo), where brands have distinct positions, the exclusion of these effects matters very little.},

First, for stayers, three types of bonds (financial, social, and structural) improve customer utilitarian and hedonic values, thus leading to enhancement of customer loyalty.

	abstract = {Customer-related measures are today often included in management accounting systems. In this paper, two situations are displayed where these measures are problematic to the managing process. The main argument of the paper is that customer accountability may serve to question demands for hierarchical accountability, as put forward in management accounting systems. The paper is based on a case study, in which two groups show strong customer accountability which is disturbing to the managing process. In the first group, socializing accountability processes to the customers override hierarchical accountability concerning delivery performance. In the second group, aligned accountability to customers and managers for customer-related measures override hierarchical demands for accountability for financial performance. The argument of the paper may be taken as a basis to question the broadening of management accounting to incorporate customer-related aspects. An organization needs to be managed in a balanced way. However, it should not be taken for granted that all aspects need to be incorporated into management accounting. With strong customer accountability, management accounting may need to be devoted to classical tasks of emphasizing financial performance and formalized processes. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of European Accounting Review is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

The main argument of the paper is that customer accountability may serve to question demands for hierarchical accountability, as put forward in management accounting systems. The paper is based on a case study, in which two groups show strong customer accountability which is disturbing to the managing process. In the first group, socializing accountability processes to the customers override hierarchical accountability concerning delivery performance. In the second group, aligned accountability to customers and managers for customer-related measures override hierarchical demands for accountability for financial performance. The argument of the paper may be taken as a basis to question the broadening of management accounting to incorporate customer-related aspects. An organization needs to be managed in a balanced way. However, it should not be taken for granted that all aspects need to be incorporated into management accounting. With strong customer accountability, management accounting may need to be devoted to classical tasks of emphasizing financial performance and formalized processes. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR} Copyright of European Accounting Review is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

	shorttitle = {"Why Should I Trust You?},
	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose {LIME}, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

The ceremonial power system is concerned with controlling the use, direction and consequences of that reconstruction while serving as the vehicle for defining the limits of technological development by dominating the legal, property and information systems. At home as abroad, the colonizer develops a system for exploiting the colonized and for legitimizing and rationalizing his hegemony.},

Although it is widely acknowledged that customer satisfaction leads to higher and more stable revenues, the relationship between customer satisfaction levels and the costs that the company incurs in producing and delivering customer services has received far less attention, and the research results vary significantly across sectors. In fact, there seems to be little guidance for linking company costs to the key elements involved in providing customer satisfaction in services, thereby diminishing the ability of a company to manage its activities accordingly. In this paper, we propose and test a framework to analyse and manage the relationship between company costs and customer satisfaction in service industries. Based on a case study from the tourism industry, we show how service components can be used as a key medium to link customer satisfaction to the cost of service production and delivery. In doing so, we provide guidance for identifying specific sources of customer satisfaction and assessing their cost, thereby extending to service industries previous research on strategic cost management.

However, these predominantly cross-sectional studies have focused on customer retention as the primary measure of loyalty. There has been little investigation into the impact on share of wallet. Using data from the Canadian banking industry, this research aims to (1) provide the first longitudinal examination of the impact of changes in customer satisfaction on changes in share of wallet and (2) determine the moderating effects of customer age, income, education, expertise, and length of relationship. Data from 4319 households using 12,249 observations over a five-year period indicate a positive relationship between changes in satisfaction and share of wallet. In particular, the initial satisfaction level and the conditional percentile of change in satisfaction significantly correspond to changes in share of wallet. Two variables, income and length of the relationship, negatively moderate this relationship. Other demographic and situational characteristics have no impact. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

In this article, the authors focus on identifying which customers are vulnerable to defection despite their stated high levels of satisfaction. Building on the recently developed Judgment Uncertainty and Magnitude Parameters ({JUMP}) model, the authors decompose customers' stated satisfaction into two related but independent facets—satisfaction level and satisfaction strength—and then examine the role of satisfaction strength in the translation of satisfaction into loyalty. Using data from an ongoing customer satisfaction tracking study being conducted by a large U.S.-based service organization, Study 1 examines the role of satisfaction strength in shaping the satisfaction–loyalty link in a business-to-business setting. Study 2, a conceptual replication in a business-to-consumer context, examines the hypothesized relationships in a service failure/recovery situation. The studies strongly demonstrate that satisfaction strength plays a central role in the translation of stated satisfaction into loyalty. A key finding is that though satisfaction translates into loyalty when satisfaction is strongly held (i.e., low uncertainty), the translation is significantly lowered, on average, by approximately 60\% when the same satisfaction is more weakly held (i.e., high uncertainty). The studies also indicate that prior relationship aspects (length of relationship, volume of business, and favorability of prior experiences) result in even greater vulnerability.

In particular, it has been claimed that traditional management accounting techniques are unable to satisfy the users of such techniques in terms of providing them with timely and detailed information. In response to this issue and to overcome the shortcomings of traditional management accounting techniques, activity based-costing ({ABC}) was introduced in 1980s. However, despite the claimed benefits of {ABC}, the level of implementation of {ABC} is still lower than those of traditional management accounting techniques. Shedding light on this debate, current study first examines the level of association between technological changes in manufacturing practices and the level of implementation of {ABC} to see whether (or not) implementation of technological changes may lead to the implementation of {ABC}. Then it tests the level of association between the implementation of {ABC} and the level of satisfaction of {ABC}'s users to see whether (or not) the adopters of {ABC} are more satisfied than non-adopters. The findings indicate that the diffusion of {ABC} is associated with the implementation of technological changes in manufacturing practices. However, the results provide no evidence to support that {ABC} adopters are more satisfied than non-adopters. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

Design/methodology/approach - A consumer survey was conducted to test moderation hypotheses, which was analyzed with hierarchical regression equations. Findings - The results show that pleasure had stronger influences on perceived service quality and satisfaction in the hedonic service context than in the utilitarian service context. Arousal is found to influence perceived service quality and satisfaction in the hedonic service context but not in the utilitarian service context. Research limitations/implications - It is likely that in hedonic related services, consumers will often use some affective criteria to evaluate service quality, in addition to the traditional service quality measures. Practical implications - Companies providing hedonic services should modify the content of their services or add novelty stimulus into their services from time to time in order to evoke the most desired consumer emotions and enhance satisfaction. Originality/value - The proposed moderating effect of service contexts improved predictions and explanations of the theoretical relationship between affect and perceived service quality/satisfaction. It specifies the conditions under which affect will or will not impact perceived service quality and satisfaction. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

Although aggregate market level research on understanding the determinants of customer satisfaction is abundant, {CSM} decisions at segment level are possible only if the individual or market segment differences in the formation of overall satisfaction judgments and subsequent heterogeneity in the role these various determinants play are understood. Based on expectancy-disconfirmation theory in customer satisfaction, we propose a maximum likelihood based latent structure factor analytic methodology which visually depicts customer heterogeneity regarding the various major determinants of customer satisfaction judgments involving multiple attributes, and provides directions for segment-specific {CSM} decisions. We first describe the proposed model framework including the technical aspects of the model structure and subsequent maximum likelihood estimation. In an application to a consumer trade show, we then demonstrate how our proposed methodology can be gainfully employed to uncover the nature of such heterogeneity. We also empirically demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over a number of different model specifications in this application. Finally, limitations and directions for future research are discussed. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

	abstract = {The consumer satisfaction literature has not, for the most part, integrated individual values into the product evaluation process. Yet a comprehensive understanding of consumer satisfaction can best be attained by including both consumer and product factors. To demonstrate the usefulness of including individual values, this research focuses on one consumer value, namely, materialism. The authors empirically explore how this individual value is linked to consumers' evaluations of products they have purchased. Using surveys, the authors collected data from a sample of college students (n = 211) and a sample of adults (n = 270). Across these two studies, using divergent samples and products, they find consistent evidence that materialism is negatively related to product satisfaction in product categories with high potential for status signaling, but unrelated to product satisfaction in product categories with lower potential for status signaling. The consumption goals that produce these product evaluations are empirically addressed. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

	abstract = {We extend the Schmittlein et al. model (1987) of customer lifetime value to include satisfaction. Customer purchases are modeled as Poisson events, and their rates of occurrence depend on the satisfaction of the most recent purchase encounter. Customers purchase at a higher rate when they are satisfied than when they are dissatisfied. A closed-form formula is derived for predicting total expected dollar spending from a customer base over a time period (0,T]. This formula reveals that approximating the mixture arrival processes by a single aggregate Poisson process can systematically underestimate the total number of purchases and revenue. Interestingly, the total revenue is increasing and convex in satisfaction. If the cost is sufficiently convex, our model reveals that the aggregate model leads to an over investment in customer satisfaction. The model is further extended to include three other benefits of customer satisfaction: (1) satisfied customers are likely to spend more per trip on average than dissatisfied customers, (2) satisfied customers are less likely to leave the customer base than dissatisfied customers, and (3) previously satisfied customers can be more (or less) likely to be satisfied in the current visit than previously dissatisfied customers. We show that all the main results carry through to these general settings. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

By using the Tetraclass model (Llosa, 1996) in the context of relationships between health practitioners and the French Social Security, it shows that there are four categories of attributes: Some have an asymmetric impact, strong only in case of good performances ("plus" attributes), or only in case of bad performances ("basic" attributes). Others have a stable impact, strong whatever the level of perceived performance ("key" elements) or always weak ("secondary" elements). Moreover, this analysis is carried out in the light of the three facets of the justice theory. It shows that the attributes concerned with distributive justice are "key" ones, those concerning interactional justice mostly "basic". The elements of procedural justice globally have a more contrasted impact ("plus" or "basic"). Lastly, the article stresses that the origin of the responsibility for the incident (single responsibility of the company versus shared responsibility) influences the impact of the attributes on satisfaction.

However, analysts have advocated a number of different customer feedback metrics including average customer satisfaction scores and the number of "net promoters" among a firm's customers. We empirically examine which commonly used and widely advocated customer feedback metrics are most valuable in predicting future business performance. Using American Customer Satisfaction Index data, we assess the linkages between six different satisfaction and loyalty metrics and {COMPUSTAT} and {CRSP} data-based measures of different dimensions of firms' business performance over the period 1994-2000. Our results indicate that average satisfaction scores have the greatest value in predicting future business performance and that Top 2 Box satisfaction scores also have good predictive value. We also find that while repurchase likelihood and proportion of customers complaining have some predictive value depending on the specific dimension of business performance, metrics based on recommendation intentions (net promoters) and behavior (average number of recommendations) have little or no predictive value. Our results clearly indicate that recent prescriptions to focus customer feedback systems and metrics solely on customers' recommendation intentions and behaviors are misguided.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship marketing ({RIVI}) strategy of a retail bank and examine whether - after its implementation - customer relationships were strengthened through perceived improvements in the banking relationship and consequent loyalty towards the bank. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted on two profitability segments, of which the more profitable segment had been directly exposed to a customer oriented {RM} strategy, whereas the less profitable segment had been subjected to more sales oriented marketing communications. Findings - No significant differences were found between the segments on customers' evaluations of the service relationship or their loyalty toward the bank. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that relationship satisfaction was less important as a determinant of loyalty in the more profitable segment. Research limitations/implications - This study was conducted as a case study of one specific branch of a bank group in Finland, which limits the external validity of its results. It was not possible to ascertain if, or to what extent, customers of the more profitable segment had received the intended {RM} treatment. Other limitations are also discussed. Practical implications - Customer orientation is desirable within retail banking and more studies are needed on the differential drivers of loyalty across customer profitability segments. By identifying the aspects of a banking relationship that are more highly valued among more profitable customers than among less profitable customers, bank managers would be able to more effectively devise appropriate strategies for different segments. Originality/value - The study contributes to the {RM} literature and marketing of financial services by providing empirical evidence of the effects of {RIVI} activities on customer relationship perceptions in different profitability segments.

To manage both groups effectively, it is essential to know how marketing activities, such as promotions, affect both groups' contributions to revenues. The authors model each group's contribution as the number of daily buyers times their average expenditures. The model also includes the number of nonbuyers because they may return as customers. Moreover, nonbuyers may influence the expenditures of other customers through crowding effects, and they use personnel time. Model application to two years of daily data from six clothing stores reveals that the number of nonmembers who buy is much more responsive to price discounts than the number of members who buy. Thus, the decomposition of the promotional revenue bump is strongly moderated by the percentage price discount and the communication mode: direct mail to members only and door-to-door flyers to members and nonmembers.

Data were collected from spectators at a large Midwestern university at two home men's (n=530) and two home women's (n=749) intercollegiate basketball games. Male respondents made up 52\% of the total sample. Two models fit well and were statistically equivalent. Model A explained 41\% of the variance in sport spectator conative loyalty; however, Model B explained 49\% of the variance in conative loyalty and lent support to the two intertwining theories. From a marketing perspective, the results indicated that it is critical to facilitate self-esteem responses to engender conative loyalty and thus attendance at future games and purchasing of team merchandise.

However, existing research has tended to focus on only a few variables which mediate the link between customer satisfaction and organizational performance (especially customer loyalty). The goal of this paper is to provide deeper insights into the outcomes of customer satisfaction by studying the link between customer satisfaction and price sensitivity, drawing upon different theoretical perspectives (i.e., transaction cost theory and equity theory). The study is based on a dyadic data set collected from salespeople and their customers across multiple manufacturing and services industries in a business-to-business context. Results indicate the presence of an inverse relationship between customer satisfaction and price sensitivity. Findings also indicate that the link under consideration is particularly strong in the case of high product/service specificity and product/service complexity. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

A significant difference existed between customers with previous positive experiences and those customers with previous negative experiences. Each group reported similar outcomes with their next visit, which leads towards a tendency of repeat performances for the business. The power of understanding the past experiences of the customer is valuable to service researchers and practitioners in understanding the importance of the perception the customer leaves with.

A method must be capable of accurately predicting the real impact of each attribute. A two-step methodology was used: first, eight satisfaction attributes were chosen for their unquestionable nature, and this choice was validated by experts using a Delphi method. The convergence of this characterization with the classifications obtained by each of the five methods was then established from a sample of 1,489 {EDF} (Electricité de France) customers. The results show that for the sector studied, no existing method demonstrates a sufficient convergent validity, despite more satisfactory results for some.

The link between satisfaction, loyalty and profitability is perceived to be so self-evident that the relationship often is taken for granted. Nevertheless, only a few studies have examined this fundamental relationship. Here the focus is on the individual customer with respect to the links between customer satisfaction, customer (action) loyalty and customer profitability. The following hypotheses are tested; H1: The more satisfied a customer tends to be, the higher is the loyalty of the customer; H2: The more loyal a customer tends to be, the higher customer profitability is obtained. As expected, the results provide strong support for the hypotheses. However, the relationships between the variables seem to be non-linear (increasingly downward sloping), and only valid beyond certain levels or thresholds. Besides, the explanatory powers of the individual variables are rather low. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

Controlling for salesperson gender and selling experience, structural equation modeling indicates that {ASB} increases self-rated, manager-rated, and objective measures of performance, whereas {CO} increases only self-rated performance. Both {ASB} and {CO} increase job satisfaction. Tests of reciprocal relationships indicate that {ASB} increases {CO} and job satisfaction increases performance rather than vice versa. Selling experience increases performance but not job satisfaction, and saleswomen rate their performance and satisfaction slightly higher than salesmen do. The magnitudes of the relationships indicate that {ASB} and selling experience have greater effects than {CO} and gender on salesperson performance. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

The empirical evidence presented in this article suggests that the answer to the first question is yes, but equally remarkable, the answer to the second question is no, suggesting that satisfied customers are economic assets with high returns/low risk. Although these results demonstrate stock market imperfections with respect to the time it takes for share prices to adjust, they are consistent with previous studies in marketing in that a firm's satisfied customers are likely to improve both the level and the stability of net cash flows. The implication, implausible as it may seem in other contexts, is high return/low risk. Specifically, the authors find that customer satisfaction, as measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index ({ACSI}), is significantly related to market value of equity. Yet news about {ACSI} results does not move share prices. This apparent inconsistency is the catalyst for examining whether excess stock returns might be generated as a result. The authors present two stock portfolios: The first is a paper portfolio that is back tested, and the second is an actual case. At low systematic risk, both outperform the market by considerable margins. In other words, it is possible to beat the market consistently by investing in firms that do well on the {ACSI}.

	abstract = {Purpose - Despite retailers' growing use of lowest-price refund policies, little is understood about how consumer satisfaction is influenced by them. This paper examines the potential role of market price volatility and store image on consumers' satisfaction of stores offering a lowest-price refund. Design/methodology/approach - Between-subject experimental design is used in which subjects are presented with simulated shopping scenarios. In the shopping simulation lowest price refunds are provided to the subjects under different price volatility and store image conditions. Consumer satisfaction is then measured. Findings - Results indicate that when market price volatility is high consumer satisfaction with lowest-price refunds tends to be significantly higher for stores with a good image than stores with a poor image. As market price volatility increases, consumer perceptions of value increases for stores with a good image, while it declines for stores with a poor image. Research limitations/implications - The results of the study are limited by the simulated shopping methodology that is used and the absence of field shopping behavior and covariate satisfaction and refund data from retail stores. Practical implications - Despite receiving the same outcome, different consumers' satisfaction with lowest-price refunds may be highly influenced by the environment. Generally, both market price volatility and store image influence consumer satisfaction. Originality/value - By identifying specific market conditions that influence consumer satisfaction with lowest-price refunds, it may be critical for certain retailers to mobilize their refund programs.

Self-service technology is where customers deliver service themselves using some form of a technological interface. There is still a great deal unknown about self-service technology, in particular its impact on consumer satisfaction and consumer commitment. With that in mind, this empirical study explores the relative impact of self-service technology on consumer satisfaction and on a multidimensional measure of consumer commitment containing affective commitment, temporal commitment and instrumental commitment. The results reveal that in a hotel context personal service still remains very important for assessments of satisfaction, and affective and temporal commitment. What is particularly interesting is that self-service technology, while impacting these constructs, also impacts instrumental commitment. This suggests that positive evaluations of self-service technology may tie consumers into relationships with hotels. A discussion and implications for managers are provided on these and other results, and the paper is concluded with further potential research. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

Participants solicited advice from experts when their decisions were low in perceived emotional difficulty but favored the advice of predominantly benevolent providers when making highly emotionally difficult decisions. Although consumers who faced emotionally difficult decisions were willing to trade off expertise for benevolence, they did not perceive this non-normative trade-off to influence decision quality. Instead, the results support a"stress buffering"effect whereby consumers were more confident in the accuracy of predominantly benevolent providers' advice.},

These variables are increasingly recognised as being sources of competitive advantage. However, little empirical research has been conducted to examine these variables simultaneously and their relationships with post-purchase behaviour. The present study was therefore designed to develop an understanding of the relationships among these variables and their influence on post-purchase behaviour. An integrative model was developed and tested using data collected from customers in the restaurant industry.

The scale proved to be reliable and valid in a detail intensive market using 220 veterinary physicians as respondents. To achieve an acceptable structural equation modeling fit, the customer value variable had to be dropped.

	abstract = {When firms' customers are located in geographically dispersed areas, it can be difficult to manage service quality because its relative importance is likely to vary spatially. This article shows how addressing such spatial aspects of satisfaction data can improve management's ability to implement programs aimed at enhancing service quality.  Specifically, managers can identify areas of high service responsiveness, that is, areas in which overall satisfaction is low but customers are highly responsive to improvements in service quality. The authors estimate the spatial patterns using geographically weighted regression, a technique that accounts for spatial dependence in the variables. They apply this methodology to a large national sample of automobile customers served by a network of dealerships across the United States. The authors also investigate the extent to which factors related to the physical and psychological landscape explain the importance that people in different regions place on dealership service and vehicle quality.

	abstract = {Despite the proliferation of loyalty programs in a wide range of categories, there is little empirical research that focuses on the measurement of such programs. The key to measuring the influence of loyalty programs is that they operate as dynamic incentive schemes by providing benefits based on cumulative purchasing over time. As such, loyalty programs encourage consumers to shift from myopic or single-period decision making to dynamic or multiple-period decision making. In this study, the author models customers' response to a loyalty program under the assumption that purchases represent the sequential choices of customers who are solving a dynamic optimization problem. The author estimates the theoretical model using a discrete-choice dynamic programming formulation. The author evaluates a specific loyalty program with data from an online merchant that specializes in grocery and drugstore items. Through simulation and policy experiments, it is possible to evaluate and compare the long-term effects of the loyalty program and other marketing instruments (e.g., e-mail coupons, fulfillment rates, shipping fees) on customer retention. Empirical results and policy experiments suggest that the loyalty program under study is successful in increasing annual purchasing for a substantial proportion of customers.

We isolate "giant" supplier economic contributions toward "midget" resellers' and investigate the effect that economic asymmetry has on reseller attitudes toward exchange relations with relatively insensitive suppliers. The study proposes that suppliers with strong links to the marketplace not only hold economic power advantages over their weaker exchange partners, but also affect attitudes, behavior, and performance by exhibiting levels of benevolence. We test this premise by analyzing reseller evaluations of two of the top three suppliers in an industry rife with turmoil and high levels of both asymmetric economic dependence and self-interest. We found that the measure of reseller dependence--percent of sales--only mattered if the supplier was the industry leader. Economic role expectations, another measure of reseller dependence, appeared stable across different suppliers in the industry, and the effect of this form of dependence on global performance was mediated by benevolence in both samples. As predicted, benevolence did not mediate the effects of either form of economic dependence on the propensity to leave.},

	shorttitle = {The Idiosyncratic Fit Heuristic},
	abstract = {Over the past few years, customer relationship management and loyalty programs ({LPs}) have been widely adopted by companies and have received a great deal of attention from marketers, consultants, and, to a lesser degree, academics. In this research, the authors examine the effect of the level of effort required to obtain an {LP} reward on consumers' perception of the {LP}'s attractiveness. The authors propose that in certain conditions, increasing program requirements can enhance consumers' likelihood of joining the program, thus leading consumers to prefer a dominated option. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that consumers often evaluate {LPs} on the basis of their individual effort to obtain the reward relative to the relevant reference effort (e.g., the effort of typical other consumers). When consumers believe they have an effort advantage over typical others (i.e., an idiosyncratic fit with the {LP}), higher program requirements magnify this perception of advantage and can therefore increase the overall perceived value of the program. The authors support this proposition in a series of studies in which the perceived idiosyncratic fit was manipulated either by reducing the individual effort or by raising the reference effort. The authors' findings also indicate that (1) idiosyncratic fit considerations are elicited spontaneously, (2) idiosyncratic fit mediates the effect of effort on consumer response to {LPs}, and (3) an alternative account for the results based on signaling is not supported. The authors conclude that the findings are part of a broader phenomenon, which they term the "idiosyncratic fit heuristic," whereby a key factor that affects consumers' response to marketing programs and promotional offers is the perceived relative advantage or fit with consumers' idiosyncratic conditions and preferences.

The objective of this article is to investigate consumers' perception of the "effort" expended by decision aids and how this perception influences their satisfaction with the decision process. The findings of two laboratory experiments show that, in comparison to human decision aids, consumers believe that electronic aids exert less effort but save them an equal level of effort. It is also shown that consumers' satisfaction with the search process is positively associated with their perception of effort saved for them by electronic aids. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Marketing decision makers are increasingly aware of the importance of shareholder value maximization, which calls for an evaluation of the long-term effects of their actions on product-market response and investor response. However, the marketing literature to date has focused on the sales or profit response of marketing actions, and the goals of marketing have traditionally been formulated from a customer perspective. Recently, there have been a few studies of the long-term investor response to marketing actions. The current research investigates one important aspect of this impact, the long-term relationship between advertising spending and market capitalization. The authors hypothesize that advertising can have a direct effect on valuation (i.e., an effect beyond its indirect effect through sales revenue and profit response). The empirical results across two industries provide support for the hypothesis that advertising spending has a positive, long-term impact on own firms' market capitalization and may have a negative impact on the valuation of a competitor of comparable size. The authors quantify the magnitude of this investor response effect for and discuss its implications for further research. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

A conceptual framework was developed in an attempt to explain and understand visitor satisfaction with the tourist shopping village experience. The results indicate the village performance on providing a unique local experience, value for money and regionally distinctive products, and opportunities for entertainment and bargain hunting were the key variables which most strongly predicted whether respondents were very satisfied or not. Surprisingly, the level of enthusiasm for leisure shopping did not have a strong influence on the visitor experience or satisfaction. Tourist shopping villages provide a unique setting in which recreational or leisure shopping occurs and are under-researched, particularly from the perspective of the visitor experience.

	abstract = {Purpose—Online retailing has become a standard component in companies' multi-channel structure. This trend also involves an increasing number of experience attribute dominated products, which traditionally rely on brick-and-mortar retailers. These manufacturers have started to open their own online retail stores. This study identifies the key determinants of e-satisfaction at different stages of shoes online shopping process.

Design/methodology/approach—We collect consumers' reviews about their online shopping experiences from online review websites. We use both qualitative and quantitative approaches to analyze the dataset, and investigate the complete process of consumers' e-tailing experiences.

Findings—this research identifies the two key factors driving e-satisfaction of purchasing experience attribute dominated products online: product selection and customer service. In particular, our findings show that product selection is critical for e-satisfaction in the pre-purchase stage, and that customer service is more important in the post-purchase stage. Lastly, the study finds that manufacturers' websites often receive more negative reviews because of their poor service recovery strategies in the post-purchase period.

Research limitations/implications—This study emphasizes the importance of adopting a dynamic approach by considering various stages of the consumer's online shopping experience. This study focuses on one specific experience good; the shoe industry.

Practical implications—The results of this study are invaluable to firms interested in providing experience attribute dominated products online. Our findings indicate that product selection and especially post-purchase service are critical for a successful e-tailing.

Originality/value—This paper emphasizes the importance of taking a dynamic view to investigate consumer's e-tailing experience. We adopt both qualitative and quantitative approaches in our study.},

Using data from a state in New England, {USA}, a multivariate binomial logit model was used to estimate the probability of being satisfied. The formation of satisfaction differs for rural disabled adults and elders. Two out of five need characteristics were found to influence satisfaction with quality of care, and four out of six enabling characteristics were found to influence satisfaction. The impact of these characteristics differs for disabled elders and adults, pointing to the need to differentiate the disabled population when developing systems of home-based care.

Associated with this, the structured measurement of tenant satisfaction is well established in England's social housing sector and has become increasingly important in informing official assessments of social landlord effectiveness. This paper investigates whether published tenant satisfaction scores are sufficiently reliable and robust to serve as a pre-eminent and unambiguous service quality measure, examines the validity of comparing recorded satisfaction rates for social landlords operating in different social and demographic contexts, and looks into how raw survey results could be adjusted to take account of 'context' factors outside a landlord's direct control.

	abstract = {Despite its widespread practice among primates writ large, social scientists have given mutual grooming among humans little attention. This research provides an important first step in describing mutual grooming among humans. A scale was developed to measure self-reported giving and receiving of grooming. In Study 1, 184 female and 94 male participants first indicated their closest emotional relationship (for example, romantic partner, best friend, etcetera). They then completed the grooming measure pertaining to that emotionally close target person. Finally, they completed indices of relationship trust, relationship satisfaction, and parental/familial affection. Individuals who focused on their romantic partners ( N = 134) reported more mutual grooming than individuals who focused on other types of relationships. Relationship satisfaction, previous experience of familial affection, and trust were positively correlated with mutual grooming for romantically involved individuals. Study 2 ( N = 71 heterosexual couples) explored psychological correlates of mutual grooming within romantic dyads. Individuals with more promiscuous attitudes and those who scored high on the anxiety subscale of an adult attachment style measure reported grooming their partners most frequently. Findings were consistent with several proposed functions of grooming: (a) potential parental-investment indicator, (b) developing trust, and (c) courtship/flirtation—all of which play roles in pair-bonding. At first glance, humans may not appear to groom each other with the same fervor as other primates. However, we posit that humans are, in actuality, groomers par excellence.

This paper aims at closing this explanatory gap by investigating the question of what it can mean for knowledge to be collective. In drawing on relevant literatures it analytically distinguishes three types of collective knowledge and elaborates on their nature. Through analysis of their interrelationship and interaction within the organization, these types are integrated into an overarching framework forming a pluralistic epistemology of collective knowledge. Finally, some implications of the proposed epistemological framework for our understanding of higher-order knowledge-related constructs (such as routines and capabilities) as well as for the architecture of firms and industries are outlined.

The qualitative characteristics of accounting information, and the particular attributes of the {MAIS} that is used, contribute to the user satisfaction but a linkage with use/usefulness and user value of management-accounting information must be considered in terms of decision-making. In the present study, the definitions of {MAIS} attributes are derived from the constructo provided by Chenhall and Morris (1986) and consolidated by Moores and Yuen (2001). These are applied to data collected in a field study of medium-sized and large Brazilian companies. Data analysis includes multivariate analysis by means of the cluster method. Results indicate that the satisfaction of users of a {MAIS} increases if the attributes of the system allow users to obtain useful information. Future research can examine which attributes of an {MAIS} make a greater contribution to the satisfaction of users of accounting information. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Using survey data from the automotive and computer industries in Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United States, we examine whether organizations following a quality-oriented strategy have adopted the strategic control practices discussed in the quality management literature. Our results indicate that organizations placing greater emphasis on quality in their strategic plans do tend to make greater use of quality-related strategic control practices. However, we find no evidence to support the claim that Japanese organizations link their control systems more closely to competitive strategies than organizations in the other countries. Instead, Japanese manufacturers appear to make greater use of many of the strategic control practices regardless of their organization's strategic emphasis The performance consequences of the strategic control practices vary somewhat by industry, suggesting that strategic control systems should be adapted to the organization's competitive environment. Finally, several strategic control practices are negatively associated with performance, consistent with claims that formal strategic control systems can actually hinder performance in some circumstances by focusing attention on formal and rigid action plans, targets, and information gathering when flexible and creative strategic responses may be more appropriate.},

The accounting literature is ambiguous about whether non-financial measures have relative or incremental information content, or both, beyond lagged financial measures for future financial performance. Although it is often stated that non-financial performance measures are better indicators for future financial performance than lagged financial performance, the empirical accounting research evaluates the incremental contribution of non-financial measures beyond lagged financial measures.

I find that in my research context the two non-financial measures absence frequency and on-time delivery do not have more relative information content than lagged financial measures. However, the non-financial measures have incremental information content beyond the lagged financial measures for both future costs and future revenues. In addition, the individual non-financial measures have different lags for costs and revenues.},

	abstract = {The concept of the customer exercising market power to obtain the desired combination of attributes in terms of price and quality of the product to be purchased has been integral to the Conservative Government's justification of privatization. However the practical import of giving effect to customer sovereignty was problematic if it was not accompanied by an increase in competition and choice for customers. This is particularly true of the recently privatized Water industry, where the monopoly character of the industry has remained unaltered. To give effect to its claims that customers would benefit, and to prevent overcharging and to protect standards of service, the Government had to introduce a new regulatory system operated by the Office of Water Services (Ofwat). In pursuing these objectives the Director General of Ofwat has stated that his aim is to secure for the customer a place that he/she would have were the companies operating in a competitive market. This paper, drawing on Miller and Rose's analysis of Governing economic life, examines the attempts that have been made to give effect to this “place for customers”. In doing so much of the analysis focuses on exploring how notions of “the customer”, and “customer service”, have been constructed through new forms of accounting and accountability, and how this new accounting for customer service has enabled the concept of “the customer” to be made operational within the newly privatized Water plcs, even though their monopoly status has remained unaltered. Central to this has been Ofwat's determination of performance indicators on levels of service to customers, its measurement of company performance against these indicators, and assessments based on these measures of companies' success in “serving customers”. The paper seeks to demonstrate how these new accounts of organizational performance required of the Water plcs by Ofwat have only been made possible by rendering “customer service” a calculable and comparable entity. The paper also looks at some of the ways in which this accounting for customer service has been incorporated into other accounts of managerial and organizational performance.},

We observe that the auditor employing {SSA} conceives the audit as a process of evidence-driven, belief-based, risk assessment. We also illustrate facets of this process, including how the auditor, by acquiring a rich understanding of how and how well management is executing its business-model, develops rich (e.g., distributional) expectations of future financial-statement amounts and disclosures. These expectations form a benchmark against which the auditor later compares and investigates management’s asserted financial-statement amounts and disclosures. Finally, we pose and respond to some of the more common questions about elements of {SSA} and complete the paper by suggesting some educational innovations and high-value targets for research.

One salient message is that {SSA} first emerged in the 1990s as an attempt to enhance audit quality in response to changes in the audit environment. Another salient message is that {SSA} continues to equilibrate, adapting to more recent environmental changes, especially society’s demand for greater protection from financial-statement fraud. Such adaptation requires ongoing, significant intellectual investments by audit practitioners and audit scholars/educators.},

We examine whether the scorecard's organization results in managerial performance evaluation judgments consistent with a recognition of the potential relations (i.e. nonindependence) of measures within a category. Supporting this idea, we find that performance evaluations are affected by organizing the measures into the balanced scorecard categories when multiple below-target (or above-target) measures are contained within a category but that evaluations are not affected when the above/below-target measures are distributed across the scorecard's four categories.},

We find consistent evidence that firms making more extensive use of a broad set of financial and (particularly) non-financial measures than firms with similar strategies or value drivers have higher measurement system satisfaction and stock market returns. However, we find little support for the alignment hypothesis that more or less extensive measurement than predicted by the firm's strategy or value drivers adversely affect performance. Instead, our results indicate that greater measurement emphasis and diversity than predicted by our benchmark model is associated with higher satisfaction and stock market performance. Our results also suggest that greater measurement diversity relative to firms with similar value drivers has a stronger relationship with stock market performance than greater measurement on an absolute scale. Finally, the balanced scorecard process, economic value measurement, and causal business modeling are associated with higher measurement system satisfaction, but exhibit almost no association with economic performance.},

	abstract = {There is considerable interest in the role of strategic performance measurement systems ({SPMS}), such as balanced scorecards, in assisting managers develop competitive strategies. A distinctive feature of {SPMS} is that they are designed to present managers with financial and non-financial measures covering different perspectives which, in combination, provide a way of translating strategy into a coherent set of performance measures. There appears to be wide variation in how these systems are configured. However, as yet, there has been little consideration given to identifying underlying information characteristics that might help explain how the systems have beneficial effects. This study identifies a key dimension of {SPMS}, integrative information, as being instrumental in assisting managers deliver positive strategic outcomes. Three interrelated dimensions of integrative {SPMS} were identified in this study. The first, strategic and operational linkages, was a generic factor that captures the overall extent to which the systems provide for integration between strategy and operations, and integration across elements of the value chain. The second attribute, customer orientation, focuses on customer linkages and includes financial and customer measures. The third dimension, supplier orientation, is based on linkages to suppliers and includes business process and innovation measures. A model is developed that predicts that integrative {SPMS} will enhance the strategic competitiveness of organizations. It is proposed that the influence of integrative {SPMS} on strategic outcomes is indirect through the mediating roles of alignment of manufacturing with strategy and organizational learning. Data from a survey of 80 strategic business units provide varying support for the proposed relationships.},

In this article, we continue this introspective process, by reviewing the theories used in 173 articles published in the Journal of Retailing in the 2004–2009 (to Issue 2) time period, and classifying those theories according to their application to various substantive issues. A total of 119 different theories were used across these 173 articles, which we sub-grouped into twelve broad-based theoretical categories: (1) marketing theories, (2) microeconomic theory, (3) consumer choice theory, (4) social exchange theory, (5) information processing theory, (6) satisfaction theory, (7) reference price theory, (8) competitive theory, (9) attribution theory, (10) other psychological theories for individuals, (11) other social psychological/sociological theories, and (12) other theories. We also examine the methodological approaches and tools used to test those theories. A number of research gaps are identified for future retailing scholarship.},

The findings suggest that chain image and store image are different concepts and that a two-level image building approach is an important aspect for petrol retailing. All the three mediating variables influence store loyalty, but image building (chain and store) seems to be more important than satisfaction creation, mediating about 2 3 of the impacts of the store loyalty drivers. However, the effects of chain image on store loyalty are entirely mediated by store image and store satisfaction, implying that the petrol station manager to a large extent can influence the drivers of loyalty.

	abstract = {Shopping is an increasingly important leisure and tourist activity (Gratton and Taylor, Leisure Management (1987) 29) reported that two-third of visitor expenditure is on shopping. Similarly, two studies by the Australian Department of the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories (Report of the Committee of Inquiry, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, 1988; Report of the Tourism shopping Implementation Committee, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, 1990) reported that shopping accounts for approximately one-fifth of overseas visitor expenditure. The growth of tourism shopping is regarded as having significant implications for retail development.

A theoretical framework is developed which states that domestic tourists can be segmented, as a result of different demographic/social characteristics, into groups with different requirements for product attributes and services. These groups can have different levels of satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the retail product and retailing servicing provision, resulting in separate dimensions of retailing satisfaction. These dimensions of satisfaction effectively become a measure of retailing performance, as perceived by domestic tourists, which can indicate directions for change in the retailing provision, so as to increase satisfaction, and ultimately, domestic tourist visitation.

In order to test this theoretical framework, two fundamental causal relationships are hypothesised. Firstly, between different dimensions of product purchasing importance and the importance of product attributes. Secondly, between the dimensions of attribute importance and the dimensions of satisfaction with product attributes and service. These two hypotheses are tested, using a database of 480 domestic tourist surveys, by the development of two separate structural equation models. Conclusions from the analysis are that a definite sequential causal relationship does exist leading to shopping satisfaction. The significance of market sectoring on demographic grounds whilst found to be useful, is supported only on broad demographic categories.},

	abstract = {{ItkA} is a new interactive exercise software tool, which provides both a training mode and a test mode. A random generator compiles exercises from a question database. In each test, students have the opportunity to score up to 50 points. The construction of {ItkA} is based on Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives in the cognitive domain. {ItkA} has been tested and evaluated in a Household Technology course. In addition to attending face-to-face lectures, students had the opportunity to practise as much as they wanted to, parallel to which seven tests were provided and evaluated. Furthermore, data were collected by use of a preliminary survey and a follow-up survey. The aim of the study was to learn more about students' learning activities and learning behaviour in the Household Technology course. The authors evaluated the students' degree of participation and their results on the tests provided. Finally, student satisfaction with course support and with the design of the course was evaluated. The results clearly show that students only learn actively when lecturers give detailed advice or tasks. Although the test results were surprisingly good, half of the students had difficulties in organizing themselves and were not able to pass all the tests in the given period. There is a significant negative correlation between average test results and the number of questions in the database. In addition, a significant positive correlation between average test time and the number of database questions was found. To minimize this effect, the number of questions should be increased for certain topics. The participants were very satisfied with the course and software support. They rated the whole course as ‘good’ and the {ItkA} software as slightly, but significantly, better. In summary, {ItkA} contributes to the improvement of Household Technology courses. Furthermore, the whole course organization was highly consistent with the needs of the students. It is, therefore, recommended that {ItkA} is implemented in future courses in Household Technology as well as in other courses. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Using quantitative (n = 713) and qualitative (n = 51) data based on a diverse sample of college students, demographic and other characteristics of {SNS} users and non-users are compared. Starting with the theoretical frameworks of Robin Dunbar and Erving Goffman, this paper situates {SNS} activity under two rubrics: (1) social grooming; and (2) presentation of the self. This study locates these sites within the emergence of social computing and makes a conceptual distinction between the expressive Internet, the Internet of social interactions, and the instrumental Internet, the Internet of airline tickets and weather forecasts. This paper compares and contrasts the user and non-user populations in terms of expressive and instrumental Internet use, social ties and attitudes toward social-grooming, privacy and efficiency. Two clusters are found to influence {SNS} adoption: attitudes towards social grooming and privacy concerns. It is especially found that non-users display an attitude towards social grooming (gossip, small-talk and generalized, non-functional people-curiosity) that ranges from incredulous to hostile. Contrary to expectations, non-users do not report a smaller number of close friends compared with users, but they do keep in touch with fewer people. Users of {SNS} are also heavier users of the expressive Internet, while there is no difference in use of instrumental Internet. Gender also emerges as an important predictor. These findings highlight the need to differentiate between the different modalities of Internet use. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Participants were a self-selecting sample of 129 females and 39 males, aged between 16 and 63. It was found that individuals scoring highly in Perceived Vulnerability to Disease reported higher frequencies of autogrooming and lower frequencies of allogrooming. Individuals who scored highly in Perceived Vulnerability to Conspecific Aggression reported higher frequencies of autogrooming, however no significant difference was found in terms of allogrooming frequency.

Content sharing inside home is usually done among family members, while that between different home networks is done by friends and even anonymous users. Especially, anonymous users could access contents in home networks which could act like home portals. To protect content in home servers, the contents can be encrypted by key and the key can be shared among users. However it is quite challenging to distribute the key to anonymous users. In this paper, we present a method for sharing contents securely among different home networks. We propose a method of content sharing between anonymous users, who have similar personal preferences about the contents. The personal preferences include user profiles and contents preference. With the proposed method, a content sharing community is created for content delivery between different home networks. The community allows content creators to deliver contents to other users, who have similar personal information and can consume the contents without any leakage of personal information. In order to verify the usefulness of the proposed method, experiments were performed. The results showed that contents in one home server were securely shared with users of the other home server, if both have similar personal information. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

The primary data collection of the research paper found that: the virtual community promoted information sharing and idea generation; and members geographically dispersed and working for different sectors managed to communicate asynchronously thus initiating both a social network and yielding usable information which can develop into knowledge once applied in a business context. This research could not comment on the knowledge creation potential of the community as information needs to be applied in a business context to become usable. The authors therefore propose further longitudinal studies of the virtual community. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

We propose and examine an alternate function of information sharing, i.e., the social construction of meaning. To accomplish this goal, we turn to social construction, social presence, and task closure theories. Drawing from these theories, we hypothesize relationships among the meeting environment, breadth and depth of information shared during a meeting, and decision quality. We explore these relationships in terms of the effects of both the media environment in which the group is situated and the medium that group members choose to utilize for their communication. Our study of 32, 5- and 6-person groups supports our belief that interpretation underlies information sharing and is necessary for favorable decision outcomes. It also supports the proposed negative effect of low social presence media on interpretation in terms of depth of information sharing; a low social presence medium, however, promotes information sharing breadth. Finally, the findings indicate that when in multimedia environments and faced with a relatively complex task, choosing to utilize an electronic medium facilitates closure and, therefore, favorable outcomes.

Furthermore, the authors analyze how customer income and different price presentation tactics alter this reaction. Results of two experimental studies using both students and non-students show that customer income attenuates the negative effect of a price increase on the likelihood of a future purchase in a particular expense category. As an underlying mechanism, the influence of customer income on future purchase behavior is partially mediated by the degree to which customers engage in mental budgeting. Moreover, mental budgeting strengthens the negative effect of a price increase on a future purchase in the same category of expenses, whereas it does not alter the effect of a price increase on a future purchase in another category. Finally, the framing of a price increase as a percentage versus in absolute terms leads to a lower likelihood of a future category purchase. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The authors focus on disentangling the direct versus indirect effects of model constructs on attitudinal versus behavioral loyalty responses. The results support the traditional chain but also show loyalty can be increased by building a trustworthy image and creating exchange-specific assets. The authors found that overall satisfaction is the precursor both to loyalty and to building {SAI}. Finally, consumers have different costs in reducing adverse selection problems with information, and thus the negative effect of product-market expertise on behavioral loyalty needs to be controlled if the direct versus indirect effects of model constructs on loyalty are to be disentangled.},

This article explores authenticity's multiplicity of meanings within the {MG} brand subculture of consumption. An ethnographic approach guided data collection, which included participant observation, photo and document reviews, informal conversations, and formal, in-depth interviews with 58 {MG} owners. The data show that {MG} owners gain a sense of authenticity in the consumption context via the object and its ownership, consumer experiences, and identity construction and confirmation. As an object, an {MG} is authentic if it broaches an ideal standard and preserves the brand heritage. An {MG} experience is authentic when an owner interacts with the car through driving and self-work activities. Finally, an {MG} owner authenticates his or her identity through role performance and communal commitment. Implications are discussed in light of brand management.},

We explore the differential effect for female versus male consumers of two psychological rewards that are provided through a loyalty program (a) high status (e.g., Gold membership), and (b) personalization, at different levels of visibility to other consumers. Across three experiments and a field study, we find a coherent pattern of gender differences in the way customers respond to different types of psychological rewards in the context of loyalty programs. The results show that men respond more positively than women to loyalty programs that emphasize status, but only when their higher status is highly visible to others. In contrast, women respond more positively than men to loyalty programs that emphasize personalization, but only for personalization in private settings.

We provide an integrated analysis of a loyalty program incorporating customers' purchase and cash-in decisions, points pressure and rewarded behavior effects, heterogeneity, and forward-looking behavior. We focus on four key research questions: (1) How important is it to combine both components in one model? (2) Does points pressure exist in the context of a two-component loyalty program? (3) How is the market segmented in its response to the combined program? (4) Do the programs complement each other in terms of the incremental sales they produce? Our most basic message is that the frequency reward and customer tier components of loyalty programs should be modeled jointly rather than in separate models. We find strong evidence for points pressure for both the customer tier and frequency reward components using both model-based and model-free evidence. We find a two-segment solution revealing a ''service-oriented'' segment that highly values cash-ins for room upgrades and staying in ''luxury'' hotels, and a ''price-oriented'' segment that is more price sensitive and highly values the frequency reward aspects of the loyalty program. Furthermore, we find that both components generate incremental sales. Also, there was slight synergy between the programs but not a huge amount. Overall, each component contributes to increased revenues and does not interfere with the other.e},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study is to examine the interrelationships among consumer relationship proneness ({CRP}), three perceived loyalty program attributes (i.e. perceived complexity, advantage, and risk), and resistance to change with participants in apparel retailer's loyalty programs. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected using an online survey with the assistance of a marketing research company. Participants were 294 members of apparel retailers' loyalty programs. Participants indicated one apparel retailer's loyalty program in which they took part. After that, they completed a questionnaire making reference to the program they had identified. To reduce measurement artifacts, dependent variables were assessed prior to their predictors. Findings – {CRP} was found to have a significant effect on perceived advantage and resistance to change. In turn, perceived advantage revealed a significant positive effect on resistance to change. The results not only verify theoretical conceptions regarding {CRP} and its effect on perceived loyalty program attributes and resistance to change, but also provide insights into the implementation and development of apparel retail loyalty programs as well as customer relationship management. Originality/value – The contributions of the research are twofold. First, it critically examines {CRP} with loyalty program members fulfilling an identified gap in the literature and testing {CRP} as a critical factor to the effectiveness of loyalty programs. Second, on a managerial level, it generates beneficial insight for apparel retailers to fine-tune their loyalty programs.},

In doing so, the study identifies both tools and methods that generate more accurate publication count rankings as well as databases that should be taken into consideration when conducting comprehensive searches in the literature for research and curricular needs. With a list of 2,625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 American Library Association– ({ALA}-) accredited {LIS} schools, hundreds of databases were searched. Results show that there are only 10 databases that provide significant coverage of the {LIS} indexed literature. Results also show that restricting the data sources to one, two, or even three databases leads to inaccurate rankings and erroneous conclusions. Because no database provides comprehensive coverage of the {LIS} literature, researchers must rely on a wide range of disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking and other research purposes. The study answers such questions as the following: Is the Association of Library and Information Science Education's ({ALISE}'s) directory of members a reliable tool to identify a complete list of faculty members at {LIS} schools? How many and which databases are needed in a multifile search to arrive at accurate publication count rankings? What coverage will be achieved using a certain number of databases? Which research areas are well covered by which databases? What alternative methods and tools are available to supplement gaps among databases? Did coverage performance of databases change over time? What counting method should be used when determining what and how many items each {LIS} faculty and school has published?

These results form a basis for nonparametric estimation of counterfactual revenue differences. I find that the revenue gain from using the English auction would be in the range of 11\%-19\% of the gross underwriting spread, and that most of it would already be captured by using the second-price auction. The recent explosive growth of Internet English auctions, administered by Grant Street Group, provides external support to the claim that auction design matters in this market.},

	abstract = {Large online social rating networks (e.g., Epinions, Blippr) have recently come into being containing information related to various types of products. Typically, each product in these networks is associated with a group of members who have provided ratings and comments on it. These people form a product community. A potential member can join a product community by giving a new rating to the product. We refer to this phenomenon of a product community's ability to 'attract' new members as product affinity. The knowledge of a ranked list of products based on product affinity is of much importance for implementing policies, marketing research, online advertisement, and other applications. In this article, we identify and analyze an array of features that exert effect on product affinity and propose a novel model, called {AffRank}, that utilizes these features to predict the future rank of products according to their affinities. Evaluated on two real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superior prediction quality of {AffRank} compared with baseline methods. Our experiments show that features such as affinity rank history, affinity evolution distance, and average rating are the most important factors affecting future rank of products. At the same time, interestingly, traditional community features (e.g., community size, member connectivity, and social context) have negligible influence on product affinities.},

The existing mechanism considers only streaming and download volumes, while the new ranking mechanism reflects more accurate preferences for popularity, pricing policy, and the slot effect based on the exponential decay of attention. The new ranking model is designed to verify correlations with two kinds of service volumes for popularity, pricing policy, and the slot effect. Slot mechanism design is analyzed in an heuristic way. Our analysis shows that music content sellers maximize benefits by assigning their own music items to the highest-ranking slot, which provides visibility. Also sellers can strategically design the slot size to influence the popularity of music items. Music content buyers gain indirect benefits by getting segmented ranking slots and reducing search costs. Empirical analysis illustrates the features of the online music industry and validates hypotheses constructed around the new ranking model. The results show that the new ranking mechanism is more effective.},

However, the debate originates from the false premise that one method must be used to the exclusion of the other. A conceptualization of the value structure that uses characteristics of both rating and ranking systems opens up theory and research to a more complex understanding of values. Data from the 1995-1997 World Values Survey demonstrate how using both rating and ranking systems can lead to distinct and equally valid conclusions about the differences in value importance among the nations of the world. This suggests that either method by itself provides an incomplete understanding of the value structure.

	abstract = {This paper offers a critical perspective on the growing phenomenon of governance indicators in international politics. I employ a governmentality approach to shed light on the political meanings and outcomes of the increasing tendency of various international actors to rate and rank the governance capacities and performances of states. In particular, I argue that, beyond being an analytic tool or an advisory system for governments, this practice in fact reproduces structures of authority and hierarchy in the international system. Power and knowledge are bound together in many governance indicators, as powerful states either examine themselves, the quality of governance of Third World states, or adopt the examinations carried out by other agents. Consequently, poor and developing states cannot simply ignore these ratings and rankings. The governance indicators establish a discursive field of state legitimacy and normalcy and 'responsibilises' states: construct them as ethical actors that are capable of correct and responsible choices and policies. As a result, the responsibility of powerful states and international actors for a host of social, economic and political problems in many Third World countries is obscured. Therefore the paper calls for closer attention to be paid to the elements of power in these governance indicators.},

In order to address these questions, I estimate a random utility model using administrative application data of all German medical schools. As identification relies on the variation in quality indicators over time, I can disentangle the response to changing quality indicators from the common knowledge regarding university attractiveness. Results show that the ranking provides more relevant information in the quality dimensions mentoring, faculty infrastructure and the overall students’ satisfaction than with respect to research.},

The online travel website {TripAdvisor} and its hotel ranking system is a prominent example of this new phenomenon. The site increasingly appears to play the role of trusted intermediary for the ‘independent traveller’ who spurns the services of the traditional travel agent in favour of making their own holiday arrangements. In this paper, we undertake netnographic research to consider the way in which {TripAdvisor} rankings engender trust. Drawing on the site’s own operational features together with an analysis of the traveller commentaries hosted within the site, we argue that the case of {TripAdvisor} is a powerful illustration of an internet mediated abstract system () that draws on calculative practices to construct trust. In addition, we speculate as to the implications of the proliferation of such internet mediated expert systems, both on the accounting profession, and on future accounting research.},

The prevailing argument is that they wield influence through encouraging ‘mechanisms of reactivity’ amongst market actors. We ask the question as to whether there are additional agential aspects found within rankings that extend ‘social’ accounts. We suggest that ‘sociomateriality’ is also a significant aspect of a ranking’s influence. Through developing the notion of a ‘ranking device’, we examine how the “format and furniture” of a ranking can mediate and constitute a domain. Drawing on a detailed study of a prominent graphical performance measure from within the information technology ({IT}) arena, we provide evidence to show that {IT} markets can be as much a product of the affordances and constraints of ranking devices as any other (non-material) aspects of the ranking. The article integrates literature from Accounting research and Science and Technology Studies to contribute to our understanding of how material things and the economy mutually constitute one another. It also offers one of the first empirical accounts of the sociomaterial construction of a graphical ranking.},

Despite the importance of these rankings, surprisingly little research has been done on the issues involved in developing the rankings. In this paper the methodologies used by three studies are examined. The sensitivity of rankings to changes in methodology utilized is examined. A change in methodology is found to result in ranking change of up to twenty two places in a ranking of 50 items. The paper also demonstrates how changing methodologies affects the weightings of the variables in the index.

We find that, on average, analysts exhibit more certainty in their range forecasts when the corporate governance rating is above average, relative to below average. We also observe a significant interaction between the corporate governance ratings and country, indicating that U.K. analysts exhibit stronger responses to a below average rating than U.S. analysts, while responses to an above average rating are not significantly different between the two countries.

We construct a framework that can weigh the pros and cons. We find that the damage done by marking-to-market is greatest when claims are (1) long–lived, (2) illiquid, and (3) senior.

The designing of bank must involve selection of those that have sufficient success potential. Hence, from several factors of success, the following three criteria factors have been: selected-customer satisfied, one dimensional, and product fully functional. These factors offers three question multi criteria group extracted from a 16 norms. Also, three criteria factors have been studied over a period of five years and important criteria for evaluating the norms.

The results obtained from a conceptual model developed for the mobile-phone sector support the idea that justice perceptions positively influence satisfaction with service recovery. Other findings are that satisfaction with service recovery positively affects trust and commitment, and that these two variables, in turn, positively affect overall customer satisfaction. Finally, the results also suggest that positive past experiences mitigate the effects of inadequate service recovery strategies on the quality of the relationship with the customers. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Self-customization is the process by which consumers seek to customize offerings to their own preferences. In this article, the authors propose that differences in self-customization procedures potentially influence (1) the product configuration favored, (2) the degree of decision difficulty in product customization, (3) the degree of satisfaction with the customized option, and (4) the degree of willingness to purchase. The authors examine these propositions in a series of studies that allow self-customization through the use of either a by-attribute or a by-alternative method. They show that consumers tend to choose an intermediate (compromise) option significantly more often when they customize a product using the by-attribute method than when using the by-alternative method. In addition, the by-attribute customization procedure leads to a lower level of experienced difficulty, greater satisfaction, and higher willingness to purchase the customized option than the by-alternative method. Finally, the decrease in experienced difficulty in the by-attribute customization method is not solely due to the reduction in information consideration but also due to less explicit trade-offs among competing characteristics. These results can aid marketing managers in designing mass-customization procedures. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {This article examines key success factors for designing and delivering combinations of goods and services (i.e., hybrid offerings) in business markets. Goods manufacturers, unlike pure service providers, find themselves in a unique position to grow revenues through hybrid offerings but must learn how to leverage unique resources and build distinctive capabilities. Using case studies and depth interviews with senior executives in manufacturing companies, the authors develop a resource-capability framework as a basis for research and practice. Executives identify four critical resources: (1) product usage and process data derived from the firm's installed base of physical goods, (2) product development and manufacturing assets, (3) an experienced product sales force and distribution network, and (4) a field service organization. In leveraging these specific resources, successful firms build five critical capabilities: (1) service-related data processing and interpretation capability, (2) execution risk assessment and mitigation capability, (3) design-to-service capability, (4) hybrid offering sales capability, and (5) hybrid offering deployment capability. These capabilities influence manufacturers' positional advantage in two directions: differentiation and cost leadership. The authors propose a new typology of industrial services and discuss how resources and capabilities affect success across categories of hybrid offers. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

In turn, this has sparked interest in concepts such as consumer world-mindedness and its impact on attitudes and behavior. The current research examines differences in consumer response to advertisements reflecting a global consumer culture positioning ({GCCP}) versus a foreign consumer culture positioning ({FCCP}) or a local consumer culture positioning ({LCCP}) and the relationship with consumer world-mindedness. In Studies 1 and 2, the authors examine the impact of world-mindedness, while controlling for ethnocentric attitudes. In Study 3, they examine the interactions of world-mindedness, international travel, and preference for authenticity. The authors develop several hypotheses and examine them using two surveys of 90 (Study 1) and 100 consumers (Studies 2 and 3) in the Netherlands. The results demonstrate, for example, that advertisements for brands with {FCCP} and {GCCP} are nomologically different and evaluated differently. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

In three cross-cultural studies on service failures, we show that these cultural tendencies have contrasting effects on consumer tolerance, such that Asian (vs. Western) consumers are more dissatisfied with social failures but less dissatisfied with nonsocial failures. We further demonstrate that these contrasting effects of culture are sensitive to pertinent contextual factors such as the presence of other consumers or a fate-suggestive brand name. Overall, our research evinces the multidimensionality of cultural influence and points to the need for a sharper focus in conceptualizing cross-cultural consumer behavior.

	abstract = {Customers often react strongly to service failures, so it is critical that an organization's recovery efforts be equally strong and effective. In this article, the authors develop a model of customer satisfaction with service failure/recovery encounters based on an exchange framework that integrates concepts from both the consumer satisfaction and social justice literature, using principles of resource exchange, mental accounting, and prospect theory. The research employs a mixed-design experiment, conducted using a survey method, in which customers evaluate various failure/recovery scenarios and complete a questionnaire with respect to an organization they recently had patronized. The authors execute the research in the context of two different service settings, restaurants and hotels. The results show that customers prefer to receive recovery resources that 'match' the type of failure they experience in 'amounts' that are commensurate with the magnitude of the failure that occurs. The findings contribute to the understanding of theoretical principles that explain customer evaluations of service failure/recovery encounters and provide managers with useful guidelines for establishing the proper 'fit' between a service failure and the recovery effort.

	abstract = {The authors present a phenomenological and longitudinal investigation of satisfaction, as revealed through consumers' ownership experiences with technological products. The study seeks to serve a provocative role in this mature research area by stepping back from the historically dominant comparison standards paradigm to question, invigorate, and, in certain ways, redirect satisfaction research along emergent lines. Although results show that the dominant paradigm of satisfaction and its competing models (i.e., those based on the confirmation/disconfirmation of preconsumption standards) are distinctly operative in some of the consumer cases, they are also found to be insufficient or even irrelevant in others. The authors consider several theoretical extensions in light of this learning and induct a new satisfaction paradigm. Overall, the findings support a more holistic, context-dependent, and dynamic process of satisfaction. This process is revealed as a multi-model, multi-modal blend of motivations, cognitions, emotions, and meanings, embedded in sociocultural settings, which transforms during progressive and regressive consumer-product interactions.

	abstract = {Instead of offering products or services alone, increasingly, firms and their partners are offering consumption systems. Consumption systems are offerings characterized by a significant product and service subsystem, as well as a pattern of consumption in which consumption occurs in multiple episodes over time. The authors develop a theoretical model for conceptualizing satisfaction with consumption systems and empirically test it using longitudinal data from 5206 automobile owners. Results show that an intertemporal examination of attribute-level performance, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions can improve an understanding of their relationships because these relationships change as the consumption of the product unfolds. For example, on the basis of their salience, attribute weights in determining satisfaction shift over time. Furthermore, the crossover effect of product and service satisfaction in determining intentions toward the manufacturer and the service provider is asymmetric, and this asymmetry reverses over time. Service satisfaction initially has a much larger impact in determining intentions toward the manufacturer, but later, product satisfaction is more influential in generating intentions toward the service provider and manufacturer. The results show that there is no direct link between satisfaction and behavioral intentions. Rather, satisfaction affects behavioral intentions in the future through a dual-mediation route.

	abstract = {The objective of this article is to clarify ambiguities in the literature regarding the relationships among three key constructs of work relationships: effort, job performance, and job satisfaction. The relationship between job performance and job satisfaction is of central interest to research in organizational psychology. However, empirical research in that area finds that the link between these constructs is weak at best. A negative effect of effort on job satisfaction is consistent with agency theory, but there is limited empirical evidence to support this assumption. Moreover, some studies have found a positive effect of effort on job satisfaction. Using a model that incorporates the main constructs from agency theory and organizational psychology, the current study finds a negative, direct effect of effort and a positive, direct effect of job performance on job satisfaction. The authors show that conflicting findings in the literature are the result of inconsistency in both the measurement and the definition of constructs across studies that do not fully account for all the relationships between constructs. The current findings emphasize the need to distinguish clearly between factors that represent employees' inputs in a work relationship (i.e., effort) and those that represent their outputs (i.e., job performance). The article also demonstrates the importance of properly accounting or controlling for all key variables to eliminate biases that can arise in empirical research on work relationships.

	abstract = {Many individual companies and some industries monitor customer satisfaction on a continual basis, but Sweden is the first country to do so on a national level. The annual Customer Satisfaction Barometer ({CSB}) measures customer satisfaction in more than 30 industries and for more than 100 corporations. The new index is intended to be complementary to productivity measures. Whereas productivity basically reflects quantity of output, {CSB} measures quality of output (as experienced by the buyer). The author reports the results of a large-scale Swedish effort to measure quality of the total consumption process as customer satisfaction. The significance of customer satisfaction and its place within the overall strategy of the firm are discussed. An implication from examining the relationship between market share and customer satisfaction by a location model is that satisfaction should be lower in industries where supply is homogeneous and demand heterogeneous. Satisfaction should be higher when the heterogeneity/homogeneity of demand is matched by the supply. Empirical support is found for that proposition in monopolies as well as in competitive market structures. Likewise, industries in general are found to have a high level of customer satisfaction if they are highly dependent on satisfaction for repeat business. The opposite is found for industries in which companies have more captive markets. For Sweden, the 1991 results show a slight increase in {CSB}, which should have a positive effect on the general economic climate. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

In addition, the article integrates these concepts through a suggested causal framework. Students evaluated either a high- or a low-involvement product in current use, reported affective responses evoked by it, and assessed their levels of product-derived satisfaction. Analysis shows that two primary dimensions of product evaluation--utilitarian and hedonic judgment-can be viewed as causally antecedent to two dimensions of affect-pleasantness and arousal-and to product satisfaction. Implications of the conceptual framework and empirical findings for the study of consumption events are discussed. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Analysis confirmed the disconfirmation effect and the effects of separate dimensions of positive and negative affect and also suggested a multidimensional structure to the affect dimensions.

	doi = {10.1207/153276602760335086},
	abstract = {We report 2 studies that served to clarify the role of consumption emotions in the satisfaction response. In the 1st study, we examined the role of consumption emotions within the expectancy-disconfirmation model of consumer satisfaction and investigated whether consumption emotions are a result of product performance or disconfirmation. The findings show that both positive and negative emotions are primarily a function of product performance and influence satisfaction even when the effects of expectations, performance, and disconfirmation are controlled. In the 2nd study, we proposed and tested an alternative framework for understanding the role of consumption emotions in the satisfaction response for situations in which consumers use more of an experiential perspective to anticipate and experience consumption. According to this model, consumers form affective expectations about how consumption of the product will make them feel, experience positive or negative emotions as a result of these expectations and product consumption, and evaluate the discrepancy between experienced and anticipated emotions. All 3 variables, then, impact satisfaction. The results empirically support many of the relations in the new model of the experiential satisfaction response but also raise several interesting avenues for future research.

	abstract = {The authors investigate whether it is necessary to include disconfirmation as an intervening variable affecting satisfaction as is commonly argued, or whether the effect of disconfirmation is adequately captured by expectation and perceived performance. Further, they model the process for two types of products, a durable and a nondurable goad, using experimental procedures in which three levels of expectations and three levels of performance are manipulated for each product in a factorial design. Each subject's perceived expectations, performance evaluations, disconfirmation, and satisfaction are subsequently measured by using multiple measures far each construct. The results suggest the effects are different for the two products. For the nondurable good, the relationships are as typically hypothesized. The results for the durable good are different in important respects. First, neither the disconfirmation experience nor subjects' initial expectations affected subjects' satisfaction with it. Rather, their satisfaction was determined solely by the performance of the durable good. Expectations did combine with performance to affect disconfirmation, though the magnitude of the disconfirmation experience did not translate into an impact on satisfaction. Finally, the direct performance-satisfaction link accounts for most of the variation in satisfaction. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Many individual companies and some industries monitor customer satisfaction on a continual basis, but Sweden is the first country to do so on a national level. The annual Customer Satisfaction Barometer ({CSB}) measures customer satisfaction in more than 30 industries and for more than 100 corporations. The new index is intended to be complementary to productivity measures. Whereas productivity basically reflects quantity of output, {CSB} measures quality of output (as experienced by the buyer). The author reports the results of a large-scale Swedish effort to measure quality of the total consumption process as customer satisfaction. The significance of customer satisfaction and its place within the overall strategy of the firm are discussed. An implication from examining the relationship between market share and customer satisfaction by a location model is that satisfaction should be lower in industries where supply is homogeneous and demand heterogeneous. Satisfaction should be higher when the heterogeneity/homogeneity of demand is matched by the supply. Empirical support is found for that proposition in monopolies as well as in competitive market structures. Likewise, industries in general are found to have a high level of customer satisfaction if they are highly dependent on satisfaction for repeat business. The opposite is found for industries in which companies have more captive markets. For Sweden, the 1991 results show a slight increase in {CSB}, which should have a positive effect on the general economic climate. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	shorttitle = {In Search of Negative Customer Feedback},
	abstract = {Customers' evaluations of quality and satisfaction are critical inputs in the development of marketing strategies. Given the increasingly common practice of asking for such evaluations, buyers of products (e.g., cars) and services (e.g., hotels, educational programs/courses) often know in advance that they subsequently will be asked to provide their evaluations. In a series of field and laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that expecting to evaluate leads to less favorable quality and satisfaction evaluations and reduces customers' willingness to purchase and recommend the evaluated services. The negative bias of expected evaluations is observed when actual quality is either low or high, and it persists even when buyers are told explicitly to consider both the positive and negative aspects. The authors examine three possible explanations for this systematic bias, which are referred to as negativity enhancement, role expectation, and vigilant processing. The findings are most consistent with the negativity enhancement account, indicating that unless buyers begin the evaluation task with low expectations, they tend to focus during consumption primarily on negative aspects of product/service quality. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of this research. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Yet, in spite of its various contributions to customer satisfaction research, this approach exhibits certain limitations, of which the authors emphasise one: contrary to compelling evidence, the model does not consider the service climate or, more specifically, the cause and effect relationship between employee behaviour and customer satisfaction. The main goal of the article is to contribute to counteracting such a limitation. A reformulation of the {ECSI} model is suggested, integrating it into key components of employee satisfaction models as they are perceived by customers. The components are satisfaction, loyalty and commitment. The {ECSI} model and the {ECSI} revised model are estimated with data from a survey carried out among supermarket customers. The results show that some variables such as perceived quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty are better explained by the {ECSI} revised model. Also, statistically significant interactions between the new variables and some of the {ECSI} model variables such as perceived product quality and perceived service quality were discovered.},

	abstract = {Assuming positive links between employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction, and firm performance lies at the heart of the marketing discipline in general and the satisfaction research in particular. However, recent research has questioned some of these relationships. Particularly, the positive links between customer satisfaction/ loyalty and profitability (e.g., Dowling and Uncles 1997; Reinartz and Kumar 2000, 2003) as well as between employee satisfaction and profitability (e.g., Bernhard, Donthu, and Kennett 2000; Tornow and Wiley 1991) have been challenged. The reason for these conflicting results may be -- among other -- based on disregarding possible time-lags-effects between the constructs. With a large-scale, longitudinal study with 119 outlets of a European {DIY}-retailer, comprising data coming from three sources from a total 46,938 customers in 2000, 144,965 in 2001, 100,351 in 2002 and 161,922 in 2003, and from 14,056 employees in 2000, 7,668 in 2001, 6,040 in 2002, and 2,755 in 2003, and biannual performance data (turnover per customer, turnover per employee and outlet profitability) for four consecutive six-month periods of the years 2002-2003, we test the following hypotheses: H1: Employee satisfaction is directly related to customer satisfaction. H2: Employee satisfaction has no direct impact on company performance (turnover per customer, turnover per employee and outlet profitability) within the same time period. H3: Customer satisfaction has no direct impact on company performance (turnover per customer, turnover per employee and outlet profitability) within the same time period. H4: Employee satisfaction in t1 is positively related to customer satisfaction in t2. H5: Customer satisfaction in t1 is positively related to company performance (turnover per customer, turnover per employee and outlet profitability) in t2. H6: Employee satisfaction in t1 is positively related to company performance (turnover per customer, turnover per employee and outlet profitability) in t2. Results We test these hypotheses using correlation analysis as well as 3SLS-estimation technique. It can be noted that no statistically significant relationship is to be found between customer satisfaction and the three performance measures, as well as there is no significant relationship between employee satisfaction and the performance measures. This is the fact irrespective of whether we look at 2002 or 2003 data. Hence, our expectation that there is no statistically significant effect to be found within the same period between attitudinal and performance measures is confirmed (H2 and H3). Results also indicate statistically significant effects of employee satisfaction on customer satisfaction both within the same time period and across periods (H1 and H4). Further, we obtain evidence that employee satisfaction positively affects turnover per employee, while customer satisfaction positively affects turnover per customer (H5 and H6). Finally, customer satisfaction also directly affects operating profit. Discussion and Implications Results of our longitudinal study offer initial support for the hypotheses we formulated. It seems that employee satisfaction is directly related to customer satisfaction and there seems to be no time-lag effect between the two constructs. Moreover and as expected, there is neither a correlation between employee satisfaction and our three performance measures nor a correlation between customer satisfaction and performance in the same year. These results offer valuable insights for management: First of all, when looking at the different performance indicators used in our study, it becomes evident that employee satisfaction is a more important driver of turnover/employee. It seems that satisfied employees could be more motivated, offer more cross- and up-selling opportunities, or more general deliver better services to customers.… [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

The authors use generalized exchange theory ({GET}) to examine how satisfaction levels of these three constituents are reciprocated. The authors examine a European franchise system comprising 50 outlets, 933 employees, and 20,742 customers. Their results show two important findings. First, the effect of owner-franchisee’s satisfaction on customer satisfaction is fully mediated by front-line employee satisfaction. Thus, managers of a service outlet can strongly impact the satisfaction and behavioral intentions of their customer base, even without direct contact with them. Second, the link between customer satisfaction and purchase intention is moderated by employee satisfaction at an outlet. The link between customer satisfaction and customer purchase intentions is almost twice as strong when employees are satisfied than when they are not. Thus, there is a ‘‘doublepositive effect:’’ not only does higher employee satisfaction at an outlet directly lead to higher customer satisfaction but it also indirectly strengthens the association between customer satisfaction and their repurchase intentions.

Findings - The test of various turnover indicators suggests that certain employee turnover indicators can perform as effectively as single-item employee satisfaction ratings do in predicting customer satisfaction. Originality/value - The finding that turnover predicts customer satisfaction as effectively as employee satisfaction is new and has important implications. More attention should be paid to managing customer satisfaction through managing turnover. Also, the use of turnover as an indicator of customer satisfaction should be explored in light of the fact that employee turnover is a naturally collected managerial measure, and does not require the costly administration of employee satisfaction surveys.

We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model of simultaneous supply and demand that allows us to formally study the financial impact of a variety of marketing activities, including those that operate on different timescales. The supply-side model provides insight into how the firm allocates resources across its various subunits. We illustrate our approach in a services context by integrating data from three independent studies conducted by a large national bank. Our model allows customer and employee satisfaction to influence firm profitability by moderating the conditional relationship between the bank's operational inputs and its proclivity to produce revenue.

Results, based on 168 independent samples (N = 51,235 individuals), indicated that {OCBs} are related to a number of individual-level outcomes, including managerial ratings of employee performance, reward allocation decisions, and a variety of withdrawal-related criteria (e.g., employee turnover intentions, actual turnover, and absenteeism). In addition, {OCBs} were found to be related (κ = 38; N = 3,611 units) to a number of organizational-level outcomes (e.g., productivity, efficiency, reduced costs, customer satisfaction, and unit-level turnover). Of interest, somewhat stronger relationships were observed between {OCBs} and unit-level performance measures in longitudinal studies than in cross-sectional studies, providing some evidence that {OCBs} are causally related to these criteria. The implications of these findings for both researchers and practitioners are discussed. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

	abstract = {The present study contributes to the knowledge of how the Kano model and questionnaire are used for classifying and prioritising customer requirements in service industries, such as the international airlines. After the literature review, the application of the Kano model in three case studies is investigated. In one of the investigations, the Kano questionnaire has been used, considering 80 customers, 15 service providers and the airline managers. The results imply that the demographic characteristics of travellers could strongly affect the Kano quality categorisation. Also, in cases where almost all of the requirements are basically 'must-be', such as customer complaints, the regular approach of Kano categorisation seems not to be as effective as expected, hence some initial actions seem necessary prior to the analysis. They might include further classification of major Kano categories into sub-categories. Although the use of the Kano questionnaire provides great advantages, the analysis might become complicated and time consuming in case of multiple groups of customers with a wide range of requirements. The results encourage airline managers to use the Kano analysis as an advanced approach for measurement of satisfaction/dissatisfaction even before developing and launching new services/products, comparing with the traditional questionnaires they regularly use after customers experience of services/products. The study has provided considerable evidence to suggest that the Kano methodology could fulfil the promise of providing service designers with a method to establish the requirements most critical to customers, and to cope with the dynamic nature of the highly competitive service market environment with emphasis on the non-linear relationship between customer satisfaction and customers' requirements fulfilment.

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study is to propose an effective mechanism of developing innovative {ICT}-enabled services from the perspective of experiential marketing with the aim to utilize a commonly used product design model of Kano. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the application of the integrative approach of mechanism, a case of innovative {ICT}-enabled residential video surveillance is given to identify customer needs based on Bernd Schmitt's five strategic experiential modules ({SEMs}). Afterward, the Kano questionnaire is developed and used in an on-line survey. Data from 668 respondents are collected and analyzed in light of Kano's method. Findings – A total of 15 innovative service requirements is identified. Among them, seven requirements are attractive and eight are one-dimensional attributes according to Kano's method of categorization. Practical implications – Under the competitive situations that most of the {ICT}-enabled service providers provide similar products and services, firms need to grasp customer needs and wants and convert them into deliverable services promptly. The result reveals that integrating Kano model with {SEMs} are good tools in exploring customer needs and wants for {ICT}-enabled services. Originality/value – To explore the experiential aspects of consumption has become the most important source for value creation. However, it is hard to find a systematic approach with common language for cross-functional design team. This study aims to solve this problem by incorporating two well-known models. Though the models used are widespread, it is rarely found in using Kano's model to explore the experiential aspects of consumption; likewise, {SEMs} are rarely implemented systematically.

Traditionally, {QFD} uses data about importance and customer's satisfaction with different requirements to identify the attributes that should be incorporated or improved in a product. As customers tend to rate basic requirements with high importance, the traditional {QFD} method tends to give higher priority to these requirements to the detriment of innovative ones. The Kano model allows the identification of exciting requirements, usually associated with innovations. Then, the integration of the Kano model in the {QFD} can allow innovative requirements to receive the necessary attention in the product's development process. Two methods, proposed in the literature for this integration, are presented and their limitations analyzed. Finally, through data collected with 289 potential consumers of draft beer mugs, the case study illustrates the proposed method. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Purpose – Customer relationship management ({CRM}) is considered a means to create competitive advantage for a company, as well as influence organizational performance. Much research has explored {CRM} users' point of view vis-à-vis successful {CRM} implementation, yet little concern has been shown regarding customers' viewpoints toward these same actions. This is surprising given that one of the beneficiaries of {CRM} is the customer. This paper aims to report the results of a study that explored the gap between actual bank {CRM} actions and customers' expectations of those actions in relation to {CRM} customers' intention to remain in the relationship. Design/methodology/approach – This study explores the gap between actual bank {CRM} implementation and customers' expectations of those actions in relation to customer retention using a survey method. A research model is presented to illustrate the theoretical relationships of the research. Findings – The findings indicate that an incompatibility exists between the interval of actual {CRM} implementation activities and customers' expectations of the interval and that this incompatibility has an adverse effect on customers' willingness to remain in the relationship. Additionally, customers and {CRM} personnel hold different perceptions regarding the frequency with which {CRM} implementation activities should be executed. Practical implications – Implementing {CRM} service efforts should be compatible with customers' expectations. Therefore, companies should pay keen attention when selecting the optimal frequency of {CRM} implementation so that it meets customers' expectations. Also, firms may be having too frequent {CRM} contact with customers, thus creating inefficient use of {CRM} resources. Originality/value – This paper explores selected variables that may influence {CRM} performance vis-à-vis its implementation. The research provides the unique perspective of the customer as a major factor to consider for successful {CRM} implementation. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Small and medium-sized enterprises ({SMEs}) are vital components of our economies, but many struggle to perform the marketing prescribed theoretically for large organisations. In practice, marketing is performed in {SMEs} through an intrinsic customer orientation, which exhibits striking resemblances to customer relationship management ({CRM}) theory. This paper presents research evidence to help us understand the impact of Internet-based technologies ({IBTs}) on the {CRM} activities (that is e-{CRM}) of {SMEs} in Ireland. A quantitative approach (online survey questionnaire) was adopted and distributed to 1445 {SMEs}. Exploratory factor analysis uncovered eight distinct yet inter-related factors underpinning the practices and processes of e-{CRM} in {SMEs}. Briefly, findings illustrate that {SMEs} are performing e-{CRM} to varying extents, reaping a range of performance benefits and facing a range of challenges. It is true that {SMEs} are not adopting e-{CRM} per se, as described in the large organisation-biased literature, but they are adopting relatively simple {IBTs} to improve their customer communication and information management capabilities and thus to create competitive advantage in their own strategic way. The study adopts a strong managerial focus, where pertinent practical implications and recommendations around e-{CRM} are provided for {SME} owner-managers, helping to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Thus, an important issue is why consumers vary in how they divide their purchases across outlets and how outlets can get a greater share of consumer expenditures. Two potential avenues for increasing customer share are to raise customer satisfaction, and increase repeat purchase through loyalty cards. This study examines the effects of customer satisfaction and loyalty cards as well as consumer characteristics on customer share spent on the primary grocery store. The findings suggest that customer satisfaction has a positive, albeit modest, effect on share while consumer economic shopping orientation has a negative direct effect on share. The economic orientation of shoppers, their felt importance of a personal relationship with store personnel, and the level of their aggregate purchase volume moderate the effect of satisfaction on customer share. Finally, the results provide mixed support for the impact of loyalty cards on customer behavior.},

Surprisingly, little research has addressed satisfaction with individual grocery shopping trips. This article therefore develops a conceptual framework for analyzing customer satisfaction with individual grocery shopping trip experiences within an overall ‘disconfirmation of expectations model’ of customer satisfaction. The contribution of the framework is twofold. First, by focusing on satisfaction with individual grocery shopping trips, previous research on satisfaction is extended to a context marked by frequently recurring, often tedious and routine activities. Understanding what causes satisfaction/dissatisfaction with individual shopping trips is required to explain overall, cumulative satisfaction with a retailer, which has been the focus of prior research on satisfaction in the retailing literature. Second, the framework synthesizes and integrates multiple central concepts from different research streams into a common framework for analyzing shopping trip satisfaction. Propositions are derived regarding the relationships among the different concepts in the framework and suggestions for future research are offered.},

The findings support the influence of perceived technology attributes (control, enjoyment, reliability, speed, and ease of use) and chat group characteristics (group involvement, similarity, and receptivity) on customer satisfaction and the moderating role of advisor communication style on these influences. Furthermore, our results show that chat group characteristics influence customer satisfaction directly as well as indirectly via perceived technology attributes. Online chat satisfaction in turn influences behavioral intentions. Finally, group-level perceptions are found to add considerably to perceptions at the individual level. Our study illustrates that structuration theory provides a sound foundation for theoretical development and empirical investigation of online group chat. Also it shows that retailers need to carefully manage the intricate interplay between technology, chat groups, and online advisors to foster a satisfying experience for customers.},

From a first-order Markov brand-switching model, serial equations are derived to estimate the retention rate using market share and loyalty. To explore the impact of loyalty and promotion programme on retention rate, data from five leading brands for three product categories were obtained to fit the developed model. Findings suggest that: (I) when the loyalty effect remains unchanged over a period of time, the greater the effect of a promotion programme, the greater the retention rate; (2) when the promotion effects among brands are similar, the retention rate varies depending on level of loyalty; and (3) when the proportion of loyal customers is high, the proportion of potential switchers affected by promotion programmes is low. In this case, the impact of a promotion programme on the retention rate is not significant. This model successfully demonstrates how the Markov brand-switching model can be employed to estimate a measure of retention rate from consumer panel data as well as to better understand how promotion affects loyalty, switching behaviour, and retention rate.

The results indicate that economic satisfaction and noneconomic satisfaction are distinct constructs with differential relationships to various antecedents and consequences.

	abstract = {Purpose - The main objective of this paper is to compare the differences that exist between the adoption of e-commerce by potential purchasers and the acceptance of the channel (re-purchase decisions) by experienced e-customers. Therefore, the paper seeks to test the influence of online shopping experience on electronic purchase decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual model, an extended technology acceptance model ({TAM}), is tested using structural equation modelling techniques. In addition, the variations that exist in e-customer behaviour are checked using a multi-sampling analysis. Findings - The findings show that the influence of self-efficacy and usefulness increases as the consumer gains online shopping experience. The motivations that lead a potential e-customer to make a purchase are not the same as those that influence an experienced customer. The paper demonstrates the evolution of customer behaviour and the need to differentiate the perceptions of consumers depending on their level of experience. Practical implications - The analysis of e-customer behaviour is a key issue for the development of e-retailing. Better knowledge about the evolution of consumer behaviour allows a better management of the e-customer-firm relationship (e-business). Firms should bear in mind the relevant perceptions of e-customers for each decision. Originality/value - Despite the importance that researchers have attached to studying e-shopping behaviour, not many papers have considered the existence of different types of decision. In fact, the majority only consider an initial stage of e-commerce and do not analyse the evolution of e-customer behaviour and the differences observed with respect to acceptance. The paper fills this gap. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

In turn, attitude is positively determined by overall satisfaction and negatively by experience with online purchase problems, while overall satisfaction is determined positively by satisfaction with the following online retailers' performance dimensions: product prices, product quality, customer service, required payment methods, perceived payment security, and delivery time.

	abstract = {When faced with competition and the ease with which customers can compare prices across sellers, Internet vendors often lower prices in a bid to increase sales. However, recent research reports that even price-sensitive customers do not always purchase from Internet vendors offering the lowest prices. In contrast, value has been considered a key motivator of customer decision making in economics and marketing. However, little is known about the role and effect of value in Internet shopping. This study examines online customer purchase decision making from the value perspective based on mental accounting theory. This study also identifies monetary (perceived price) and non-monetary (perceived risk, convenience, and pleasure) determinants of value. This study further explains how the individual determinants affect online purchase decision making directly and indirectly though value perception. The findings of this study offer Internet vendors practical suggestions for increasing online sales. This study, with its results, also helps advance knowledge of electronic commerce. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

	abstract = {Customer Relationship Management ({CRM}) has its own level of importance not only from the organization's point of view but also from the customer's point of view. Retaining the customer in today's competitive atmosphere is a challenge for the firm. Companies have found that they need to invest in {CRM} for better understanding of the customers so that they can respond quickly to their demands. To satisfy customers in terms of service quality include functional quality along with technical quality. This is possible through customer relationship management. The telecom sector is very important in India because in 1991, India had just 5 million telephone subscribers. At the end of July 2007, there were 233 million subscribers thus showing an average annual growth rate of over 27 per cent per annum. No other country in the world, other than China, has shown such high rates of growth in the number of telephone subscribers. Telecommunications is the only industry that has shown significant improvements over time. Consequently it is generally opined that a revolution of sorts is taking place in the Indian telecoms industry. Hence, it is very interesting to study from the point of view of customers.

	abstract = {From the very beginning of the Internet, a decisive shift from supplier power to consumer power was predicted by several authors and is still maintained in recent literature. Although the Internet has grown rapidly within the last years and electronic markets have evolved, a theoretical framework for consumer power on the Internet still cannot be identified. Few authors have taken efforts to apply common concepts of power theory to the characteristics of the Internet. Based on the concept of French and Raven, this paper analyses consumer power in traditional markets and then compares it to the situation on the Internet. This comparison shows that the Internet enables consumers (a) to overcome most information asymmetries that characterize traditional consumer markets and thus obtain high levels of market transparency, (b) to easily band together against companies and impose sanctions via exit and voice, and (c) to take on a more active role in the value chain and influence products and prices according to individual preferences. A broad literature review reveals that empirical findings confirm these hypotheses to a great extent. The authors conclude by summarizing the results and drawing implications from two different angles, namely from a marketing and a consumer policy perspective. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Our work also studies the relative value of each type of data in developing higher quality customer data and superior {CRM} systems. These data tell managers how to organize their priorities in terms of data learning activities to create the highest quality {CRM} data so that improved performance can ensue.

It is suggested that, similar to the Net  Promoter® Score ({NPS}), {NWOM} is a good measure to capture both loyalty and  advocacy among existing customers, while negative information may also have a  strong effect on purchase decisions by potential customers. The number of brand  choices and brand commitment are addressed across industries. It is proposed  that brands (particularly services) in high-commitment/low-choice sectors have to  be more sensitive to {NWOM}, while {PWOM} may be a better predictor for  business growth in low-commitment/high-choice industries. Finally, using data  from 'Advocacy Drives Growth', a new {WOM} measure in the form of a 'Net  Advocacy Score' is presented. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

With a sample of retailers of home appliances that are integrated in a buying group, the empirical test of two alternative models about the antecedents and consequences of {RSI} has confirmed that the concept plays an important and significant mediational role in explaining the effects of environment and relational characteristics on the retailer's satisfaction with the buying group.

	abstract = {This paper presents research that uses cognitive and affective semantic differential scales to construct an attitude measuring instrument to be used in the services domain in the context of long applications to buy a service. The scales measure 'Attitude to the Application Process' ({AAP}) which represents satisfaction, as an internal 'buying process' attitude, which moderates the buying intention. Data collected over a three-year period between 1996-9, was analysed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The results provide evidence of a robust and useful cognitive scale. Although there were anomalies in the exploratory and confirmatory analysis of the affective scale, a robust scale is presented which represents either one or two factors. The whole measuring instrument of 14 items was developed as a means to access applicant attitudes during the application process to university -- an extended and extreme application situation for first-time consumers. The results identify that the instrument is sound and can be used in its original or modified form, depending on the context of the service-process monitoring situation. The scales represent aspects of attitude not dealt with extensively in the literature and measure the perception of the application process as simple, open,friendly and helpful. These aspects of satisfaction mirror three attributes of service quality: assurance, responsiveness and empathy identified in previous research. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

As women's activities in sports, including tennis, are growing, it is necessary to investigate their clothing needs in order to meet consumers’ needs. A final sample consisted of 124 women who attended a Cortec United States Tennis Association Women's Pro Tournament. The questionnaires were personally distributed and collected during the tournament. The theoretical base for this study was the Engel, Blackwell, and Miniard model on consumer decision making. There was a positive significant relationship between pre-purchase satisfaction and post-purchase satisfaction ( P {\textless} 0.01). There was a positive significant relationship between pre-purchase satisfaction and fashion involvement ( P {\textless} 0.001). Also, there was a positive significant relationship between post-purchase satisfaction and fashion involvement ( P {\textless} 0.001). Comfort was identified as the most important clothing attribute and fit the second most important for women to achieve satisfaction before and after purchasing tennis apparel. Seventy-two percent of the women indicated the need for improved fit of tennis wear. Women of all ages reported garment length as a problem for each garment type. Two major reasons for not purchasing tennis clothing were high prices and inappropriate sizes. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

First, they account for the independent effects of the reinforcement dimension of control, in addition to the information dimension traditionally studied. Second, to reflect the varied behaviors that supervisors attempt to control, they disaggregate behavior control into activity control and capability control. Third, they delineate the direct and mediated effects of control on salespeople. Their proposed framework was tested with data collected from 270 salespeople in five industrial product divisions of two Fortune 500 companies. The findings suggest that managers must carefully match controls-in-use with desired results. Overall, the results show that information and reinforcement effects vary, which suggests the need to distinguish between the information provided and the actual reinforcements administered to salespeople. They also show that activity and capability control have different effects and draw a sharp distinction between two types of behavior control. Finally, the results suggest that supervisory controls primarily have indirect effects on salesperson performance, but both direct and indirect effects on satisfaction [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Although prior research has established a link between service-worker customer orientation and performance outcomes, little research has addressed other potentially important outcomes of customer orientation. Drawing from the literature on person-situation interaction and fit theory, the authors develop and test a model that explains how service-worker customer orientation affects several important job responses, including perceived job fit, job satisfaction, commitment to the firm, and organizational citizenship behaviors. Across three field studies in two distinct services industries, the results indicate that the positive influence of customer orientation on certain job responses is stronger for service workers who spend more time in direct contact with customers than for workers who spend less time with customers. The authors discuss the implications of the results for services marketing managers and researchers. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Through developing an empirical model, this research explores the links between online relationship bonds (financial, social and structural bond), online relationship satisfaction and commitment, and online relationship length, depth and breadth with the online financial services. Data from 686 online customers of a security corporation indicates that online relationship bonds influence online relationship satisfaction and commitment, except for the link between financial bond and relationship commitment. Results also identify that online relationship satisfaction influences relationship length and depth, whereas online relationship commitment has a positive impact on relationship length, depth and breadth. In sum, this study concludes that financial bond is the most important attribute in enhancing online relationship length, whereas structural bond contributes a lot to online relationship depth and breadth.

Customer information is used to serve customers and deliver the right messages to the right customer groups. Owing to the nature of financial services – that is, the need for credibility, long-term commitment and involvement of sensitive personal information – the planning and implementation of suitable marketing is extremely important. Financial services are offered through multiple channels, but electronic channels have increased in importance both for customer acquisition and retention purposes. In addition, electronic channels offer personalization possibilities that did not exist before. In this study, we examine, with the help of electronic focus group interviews, the kind of channels customers prefer when promotional messages include different types of personalization. In addition, the acceptance of promotional messages in the online banking context is explored. The results indicate that the channel preferences of customers diverge depending on the type of personalization used in the message. Furthermore, based on the opinions of customers concerning several authentic online banners, a personalization matrix was developed. The findings show that preference-matching personalization with informative content is accepted by the majority of customers. The article offers financial managers new perspectives on bank marketing in general, and online bank marketing in particular. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

The aim is to use the consumer's point of view in order to assess the relevance of the different attributes of a retail zone. Some methods which are usual in service marketing researches prove to be efficient in this scope. First, this research shows that the consumer satisfaction towards a shopping zone is at least as important as its accessibility for the success of a commercial place. Some attributes play therefore an essential role when others can be considered of much lesser importance. This paper shows also that the consumers use slightly different criterias when evaluating peripheral shopping malls and the city-centre streets. (English) [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

L'analyse des différents attributs d'une zone commerciale montre ensuite que tous ne contribuent pas de la même manière à la satisfaction des consommateurs.

It tends to investigate determinants of career satisfaction for salesmen in terms of perceived financial rewards, intrinsic rewards and the organizational environment. According to the author, tests of intellectual abilities and tests of personality traits are related to sales performance, although the relationship is not particularly strong. In terms of rewards, it is generally believed that the typical salesman is financially motivated far more strongly than the average employee in his company, which is typical of the conventional wisdom that monetary rewards are the primary motivators of sales effort. However, it has also been recognized that psychological incentives, such as recognition by role definition and opportunities for personal growth, also play an important role in motivating salespeople. As indicated by recent research work in this area, growth needs were the most important to the attainment of career satisfaction, specially for people in transportation and distribution management.},

	abstract = {Brand acquisitions and disposals are key strategic marketing decisions and often the largest single marketing investments that firms make. Yet little is known about the performance effects of such decisions. This study examines stock market reactions to brand acquisition and disposal announcements in 31 consumer industries. The results reveal that returns to such announcements depend crucially on three complementary firm assets-marketing capabilities, channel relationships, and brand portfolios-but that these effects may not be symmetric across brand acquisitions and disposals. Acquirer abnormal returns are greater for firms with strong marketing capabilities and those that buy brands with higher price/quality positioning than their existing portfolio. Investors also reward buyers that identify cost synergies in integrating new brand(s) into their portfolios but punish those that identify revenue synergies. Conversely, greater abnormal returns arise for sellers with inferior channel relationships and for those selling multiple brands, brands with relatively lower price/quality positioning than the seller's remaining portfolio, and brands unrelated to the rest of the seller's portfolio. The results from a paired subsample provide new knowledge about the positive net shareholder wealth created from brand acquisition-disposal transactions and indicate a strong role of marketing capabilities in creating this wealth.

This effect, however, is attenuated for choosers who are familiar with the choice domain, who do not rely on the presence of categories to perceive the variety available. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Specifically, it remains to be examined how online shopping attributes empirically affect changes in satisfaction that leads to repurchase behaviours over time and why. The present study develops a theoretical framework for conceptualizing satisfaction with temporal effects and empirically tests it using longitudinal data from 219 online customers. The results indicate that the relationship between attribute-level evaluations and satisfaction, which has only been examined in terms of predictors of satisfaction in prior literature, is dynamic and changes over time. Changed attributes (particularly convenience and site design) might signal an opportunity to capture the dynamics of attribute-level evaluations over time. Furthermore, the findings reveal significant temporal effects of satisfaction and purchase intention at time point T on satisfaction and purchase intention at time point T + 1. The results suggest that temporal effects occur as a diagnostic function of a previous attribute rating of a subsequent satisfaction evaluation and the consumer's level of subjective knowledge.

However, in order to better serve their own clientele, as well as their parent organizations, they need to listen to the voices of their customers, the library users.

Survey data were collected from 300 fans of more than 40 professional and collegiate teams involved in seven sports. Results suggest that both team identification and satisfaction with team performance impact multiple consumption behaviours, as represented by fans' intentions to engage in future consumption. Team identification was found to have the greater impact on consumption behaviours, suggesting that a sports organization's continuing efforts to bond with its fans may provide greater benefits than efforts to improve the team's competitive performance.

Study aim also to test the significance of socio-demographic variables in determining healthcare quality, patient satisfaction, and patient trust. Patient perception of healthcare quality was measured using modified {SERVQUAL} model and results indicate that it appears to be a consistent and reliable scale. Finding indicate that, while patient perception of healthcare quality has a strong and positive impact on the patient satisfaction and patient trust , patient satisfaction has also significant impact on patient trust. Moreover, patient satisfaction appears to play an important mediating role in increasing the strength of the association between healthcare quality and patient trust in healthcare service provider. Results confirm the varying importance of some socio-demographic variables on patient perception of healthcare quality, patient satisfaction, and patient trust. It has also been found that private hospitals have higher overall healthcare quality than public hospitals. Study indicate that patient of private hospitals are more satisfied and feel more trust in healthcare service provider than public hospitals. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

This study proposes a set of hypotheses based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model ({ELM}) of persuasion, a conceptual model that explains the formation of individual attitudes that are prompted by central and peripheral cues. The model proposes the use of central signals when the buyer is highly involved and peripheral signals when the buyer is less involved. Nevertheless, the results of this study would suggest that these relationships are not so clearly defined in the case of online buying, which implies that certain assumptions associated with the {ELM} need to be revised to take the particularities of the online context into account. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {This paper examines the incremental effect of overcompensation as compared to simple compensation on post-complaint satisfaction. In overcompensation, consumers are entitled to a refund that is more than the purchase price, whereas in simple compensation, the refund given is equivalent to if not less than the purchase price. A meta-analysis of 17 experimental studies shows that overcompensation has a substantially lower incremental effect on post-complaint satisfaction than simple compensation. However, when distinguishing between transaction-specific satisfaction and cumulative satisfaction, the smaller effect size of overcompensation mainly holds true for transaction-specific satisfaction. For cumulative satisfaction, the effect size of overcompensation is only marginally smaller. While counter-intuitive, these results appear to have a basis in three established theoretical frameworks, namely the Weber-Fechner law, prospect theory, and the different phenomenologies of the two satisfaction constructs. Implications are discussed for marketing research as well as for complaint management. Areas for future research are also explored. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Six factors are found to significantly affect satisfaction in e-businesses: adaptation, commitment, network, assortment, transaction ease, and engagement. Further, we discover that the positive effect of satisfaction on loyalty is moderated by customer trust and inertia. At lower levels of inertia and trust, customer satisfaction has a greater effect on loyalty. Actionable recommendations are provided for e-business managers to enhance customer satisfaction.

Pour améliorer l'efficacité des politiques de satisfaction clients, il est usuel de calculer les « poids » des différents attributs dans la construction de la satisfaction globale. Mais selon les niveaux de satisfaction des clients, ces poids peuvent varier (effets dits « asymétriques »). Pour pallier les limites communes aux principales méthodes de mesure de cette asymétrie, cet article propose des solutions qui (i) simplifient l'évaluation du mode de contribution d'un attribut ; (ii) permettent de mieux gérer les priorités entre attributs ayant des modes de contribution proches (cas courant sur un marché concurrentiel) ; (iii) contrôlent les effets des autres attributs tout en tenant compte de la nature au mieux ordinale des mesures ; (iv) proposent aux praticiens un outil d'analyse des résultats intégrant à la fois le poids total de chaque attribut et son niveau d'asymétrie.

	abstract = {The positive influence of customer satisfaction on brand and dealer loyalty is often taken for granted. In this study we attempted to prove whether this relationship really exists. In order to do so we examined the case of an automobile-dealer network. Three different types of customer satisfaction were distinguished. (a) satisfaction with the car, (b) satisfaction with the sales service and (c) satisfaction with the after-sales service. It was expected that all three types of satisfaction would have an influence on brand loyalty as well as on dealer loyalty. More specifically, it was expected that satisfaction with the car would be the major determinant of brand loyalty and that satisfaction with the service (both sales- and after-sales service) would be the major determinant of dealer loyalty. Furthermore, a study of the literature revealed that dealer loyalty might also significantly affect brand loyalty. In the empirical part of the study, customers (n = 416) of different automobile-dealers of the same brand were asked to fill in a mailed questionnaire. The three different types of customer satisfaction and the intention to buy from same brand of car again, as well as the intention to buy from the same dealer again were measured. The customers were also asked why they would buy the same brand (again) or from the same dealer. In general, the analyses of the results revealed that customer satisfaction with the car, as well as dealer loyalty are major determinants of brand loyalty, customer satisfaction with the sales service as well as with the after-sales service are major determinants of dealer loyalty and dealer loyalty is an intervening variable in the relation between satisfaction and brand loyalty. Furthermore, it was found that the strength of the relationship between different types of satisfaction and loyalty indicators differs markedly between various market segments (private/business use of car and new/used car buyers).

The analysis is based on data from 511 industrial customers from the United States and Germany, 201 of which reported on a transnational relationship. The results indicate that quality and flexibility are important antecedents of customer satisfaction. These antecedents were significantly lower in transnational relationships than in domestic ones. Using equity theory and the confirmation/disconfirmation paradigm, the authors develop alternative models for describing the relationships between customer satisfaction and its antecedents in transnational as opposed to domestic relationships. The findings reveal that there are no structural differences between transnational and domestic relationships regarding the relationships between customer satisfaction and its antecedents. Specifically, a lower level of customer satisfaction in transnational relationships is due to lower levels of the antecedents and does not constitute an effect of transnationality per se.

Previous research in behavioral science has suggested that the time sequence of service delivery may affect customer evaluation of service and therefore it may also affect e-satisfaction. To determine how much to invest in pre-sale services relative to post-sale services, e-tailers should examine the impacts of customer satisfaction with services delivered in each phase on repurchase intention and overall service rating. In this paper, we measure these impacts and find that post-sale service has a much stronger impact on customer repurchase intention and overall service ratings compared to service delivered pre-sale. Because of this recency effect (buyers give more weight to e-service they receive late than to e-service received earlier), e-tailers are advised to put a strong emphasis on post-sale service.

	abstract = {Customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction has become an important issue for marketing practitioners. The authors examine the issue in terms of customer service. In particular, practitioners and academicians have noted that simply investing in greater service delivery may not return the cost of the additional investment. Part of the problem is that customers' response to service increments can be nonlinear, and satisfaction and dissatisfaction thresholds may not occur at the same point. The authors propose a method for analyzing this complex behavior in a way that can lead to the development of more accurate service strategies through an understanding of the relationships among customer-transaction costs, satisfaction, and purchase loyalty. They use a catastrophe model to describe a service loyalty customer-response surface. Then, by presenting a "real-world" application with a small service-quality customer dataset provided by General Electric Supply, they show how one actually estimates such a model and interprets the results.

Although research has shown that many factors influence perceptions of satisfaction and quality, it has failed to consider the potential for asymmetric effects that shift over time and are based on the attributes used to form such perceptions. Using automobile ownership experiences during the manufacturer warranty period, the authors show that as consumers approach the end of their product's warranty period, satisfaction with attributes that can be remedied ("resolvable" attributes) declines at a greater rate, yet its effect on satisfaction with product quality intensifies. In contrast, satisfaction with attributes that cannot be remedied ("irresolvable" attributes) declines at a lesser rate, and its effect on satisfaction with product quality weakens over time.

	abstract = {The authors propose a framework for understanding key mechanisms that shape satisfaction in individual encounters, and loyalty across ongoing exchanges. In particular, the framework draws together two distinct approaches: (1) agency theory, rooted in the economic approach, that views relational exchanges as encounters between principals (consumers) and agents (service providers) and (2) trust research that adopts a psychological approach toward consumer-provider relationships. In so doing, the authors specify how trust mechanisms cooperate and compete with agency mechanisms to affect satisfaction in individual encounters and influence loyalty in the long run. Because a multidimensional conceptualization of trust is used, the hypothesized framework offers a fine-grained understanding of the interrelated mechanisms. The high level of specificity allows extraction of multiple propositions, facilitates empirical testing, and encourages theoretical development of the proposed model. Several directions to guide future research are provided. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

This paper identifies a series of market trends and technological advances which are likely to affect Croatian retail logistics over the next 10–15 years. The results of the study conducted on the sample of Croatian retailing managers reveal that Croatian retailers have not yet recognized the importance of new logistics technology and that they do not use them sufficiently. Although retail sector is facing significant pressures to offer high level of service, knowledge and skills of their employees and to reduce cost as well, Croatian retailers do not see the opportunity of Internet based technologies to improve the knowledge of their employees as the most important source of the company. They use some Internet technologies mostly in advertising, the process of ordering and all transactions with suppliers, and the communication with other business entities.},

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to assess the performance of business units in a business-to-business (B2B) environment, by presenting a framework including tangible (hard) and intangible (soft) elements. The intangible part encapsulates internal service quality and job satisfaction, whereas the tangible part includes quantifiable elements. In this study, the dimensionality of the {INTSERVQUAL} instrument is tested in a B2B environment through Confirmatory Factor Analysis ({CFA}), and its ability to explain job satisfaction is explored with regression analysis, both in isolation and together with other tangible elements. An optimisation framework is then proposed, with respect to the satisfaction-internal-service quality-performance triad in a B2B environment, based on a two-phase data-envelopment analysis model. 'Interactive' and 'physical' quality, as extracted from {INTSERVQUAL}, assesses internal service quality ({ISQ}) sufficiently and appropriately in a B2B environment. In addition, the results suggest that internal customers' job satisfaction, which depends on the soft (interactive and physical) {ISQ} dimensions, as well as the 'hard' {ISQ} dimensions, succeeds in accounting for measurable effects on the outcomes (performance) of the businesses. Managers of service firms should focus on both soft and hard dimensions of internal service quality, as they influence job satisfaction and, as a consequence, business performance. Moreover, the benchmark method ({DEA}) provides useful information about the efficiency of the set of decision-making units. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Based on institutional theory, we argue that the effectiveness of marketing practices decreases when firms are motivated to adopt such practices under the influence of institutional pressures originating in firms' environments. However, alignment between a practice and a firm's marketing strategy may buffer against these negative effects. We apply these insights to the case of customer relationship management ({CRM}). {CRM} is considered an important way to enhance customer loyalty and firm performance, but it has also been criticized for being expensive and for not living up to expectations. Empirical data from 107 organizations confirm that, in general, adopting {CRM} for mimetic motives is likely to result in fewer customer insights as a result of using this practice. Our study suggests that institutional theory has much to offer to the investigation of the effectiveness of marketing practices. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Results indicate a direct positive effect of work-related effort on job satisfaction that is not mediated by sales performance. This is inconsistent with commonly accepted theoretical models and suggests that the perspective of work as a "terminal value" (i.e., an end in itself, rather than strictly a means to an end) has been underemphasized in models of work behavior. As such, either (1) measures of sales performance should be broadened to encompass the terminal value perspective on the psychological value of work or (2) conceptual models should be revised to reflect that narrowly defined measures of sales performance do not completely mediate the effect of effort on job satisfaction. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial implications of these findings. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Analysis is based on 22 interviews with shop managers and a nationwide survey of 826 charity shop managers. In exploring job characteristics we find that managers exhibit low levels of satisfaction with factors such as pay, job status and working conditions. However, in exploring communication we find a form of ‘altruism payoff’ whereby managers’ dissatisfaction is ameliorated by the fulfilment gained from interpersonal relationships with other staff members and the knowledge that their efforts are benefiting a charitable cause. In closing we draw out the policy implications of the study for charity retail organisations and suggest directions for further research. [Copyright \&y\& Elsevier]

In contrast, negative feedback serves an informational function, but not a motivational function, and improves performance to a relatively small extent. Further, whereas positive output feedback is found to have the strongest total effect on performance, positive behavioral feed- back appears to have the strongest total effect on satisfaction. Interestingly, neither negative output feedback nor negative behavioral feedback seems to reduce sales-people's satisfaction with supervisors. Finally, contrary to expectations, sales-people's acceptance of supervisory feedback does not appear to moderate these relationships in general. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

In a test of this model, employee perceptions of organizational obstacles were measured in a retail banking environment. For employees in highest contact with customers (i.e., tellers), reports of co-worker obstacles, work environment obstacles, and workbreak scheduling obstacles were associated with lower levels of customer satisfaction. However, there was very little relationship between tellers' perceptions of obstacles and tellers' job satisfaction. For employees in positions associated with more experience and commitment (i.e., account representatives), information timeliness obstacles were linked with higher customer satisfaction, while materials, workspace sharing, and work environment obstacles were linked with lower customer satisfaction. Also for account representatives, the majority of obstacle types negatively affected their job satisfaction. These results are interpreted and discussed and managerial implications are examined.

They find that (1) optimization procedures lead to substantial profit improvements over the current practice for all types of promotions (customized and undifferentiated); (2) loyalty promotions are more profitable in online stores than in offline stores, while the opposite holds for competitive promotions; (3) the incremental payoff of individual-level over segment- and mass market–level customized promotions is small in general, especially in offline stores; (4) for categories that are promotion sensitive, individual-level customized promotions can lead to a meaningful profit increase over segment- and mass market–level customized promotions in online stores; and (5) low redemption rates are a major impediment to the success of customized promotions in offline stores. Optimal undifferentiated promotions should be the primary promotion program in this channel, and firms can benefit from offering a combination of optimal undifferentiated and customized promotions for suitable categories in offline stores.

	abstract = {The perspective of marketing has changed from regarding marketing as a series of independent transactions to a dynamic process of establishing, maintaining and enhancing relationships. In an emerging theory of relationship marketing, both trust and satisfaction are core concepts in understanding the dynamics of how relationships evolve. Although the literature has thoroughly examined both trust and satisfaction, the interrelationship between them, including their consequences and antecedents, has not yet been addressed properly. We propose that the development of buyer-seller relationships can be understood as a sequence of decisions buyers make regarding whether they should enter a relationship, continue a relationship, or enhance the scope of a relationship. These are different kinds of decisions where satisfaction and trust are likely to play different roles in risk reductions depending on the nature of the decision to be made. In a study of institutional buyers of a food producer we find that satisfaction and trust are complementary in the sense that trust is a key variable when decisions are related to enhancement in scope of the relationship, whereas satisfaction is a key variable when the issue is relationship continuity.

	abstract = {Consumer communications are received by firms through two primary channels. In the first, consumer inputs are solicited as part of an ongoing market research process. In contrast, a second form of communication flow results when consumers voluntarily contact the organization with messages of complaint, compliment, or information. Analysis of the two forms of information acquisition shows that they differ on a number of important dimensions critical to the strategic implications of the data obtained. It is also widely observed that these disparate firm-initiated and consumer-initiated information flows are handled by separate departments within the organization and are viewed as serving separate purposes. Moreover, the keepers of these pools of information, market research and consumer affairs respectively, rarely communicate or share data bases. To address these issues, we explore the theoretical basis for a solicited or unsolicited response and the meaning of the response to the firm, discuss the corporate interpretation attached to market research and corporate affairs data apart from its actual numeric content, explore the pragmatic implications of acting on the basis of data from either group, given that both sets of data have inherent imperfect ions, and suggest a research program which addresses the issues raised by this analysis.

The author notes that, in the case of Japan, it took 20 years after the introduction of quality control before the trade balance turned positive. In contrast, the U.S. mass media began to pay attention to the quality movement at the beginning of the 1980's, so information about it has been rapidly diffused. Some firms implement total quality management ({TQM}) simply because it is the fashion, leading quality activities in such companies to be short-sighted.

	abstract = {The marketing literature suggests that customer satisfaction is associated with firms' sales or market share. Satisfied customers are likely to repurchase the brand, to recommend it to other customers and to pay a price premium to keep the benefits of that brand. However, not only little empirical research has been done on the association between satisfaction and market share but also researchers have assumed that the relationship is linear. The present paper reexamines that proposition in light of the recent studies, which have reported the existence of thresholds in the satisfaction — loyalty/{WOM} relationships. The findings show that the association between variation of the firm's position in customer satisfaction and variation of market share is non-linear (increasing returns). In other words, satisfying customers' needs is not enough. It is only after a certain level of customer satisfaction relative to the competitors has been exceeded that the firm's efforts start to pay in terms of market share. However, this relationship is industry specific: firms in the non-durable sector are more likely to reap the benefits of superior position in customer satisfaction compared to the other sectors. (English) [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]
Selon la littérature marketing, la satisfaction des clients permet à une entreprise d'augmenter ses ventes ou sa part de marché. Les clients satisfaits achèteront de nouveau la marque, la recommanderont à d'autres consommateurs et payeront un « supplément de prix » pour conserver les avantages de cette marque. Cette relation a non seulement été pou étudiée empiriquement mais, en plus, la plupart des auteurs supposent qu'elle est linéaire. Or de récentes études soulignent que la relation entre la satisfaction, la fidélité (réachat), et le bouche à oreille strait non linéaire. La présente recherche réexamine donc la relation entre la satisfaction et la part de marché au regard de ces récentes études. Les résultats montrent que la relation entre la position concurrentielle d'une entreprise en marché de satisfaction et sa part de marché est non linéaire de forme cubique positive (rendements croissants). En d'autres termes, il existe un niveau de performance à atteindre (en matière de satisfaction) par rapport aux concurrents pour que la satisfaction rapporte des résultats appréciables en termes de part de marché. Cependant, cette relation varie selon les secteurs : la satisfaction a des effects plus marqués sur la part de marché des entreprises qui vendent des biens/services non durables que sur celle des entreprises de biens/services durables.

A primary problem is that the measures used in Morgan and Rego (2006) do not adequately adjust for the presence of neutral word-of-mouth activity. Nevertheless, Morgan and Rego (2006) provide important information regarding other common customer metrics and firm financial outcomes.

This research provides a summary of the claims made regarding {NPS}, reviews the research conducted on this topic to date, and provides a holistic examination of two scientific studies that test the claims made. The two claims being tested are that (1) {NPS} is the single most reliable indicator of a company's ability to grow and (2) {NPS} is superior to customer satisfaction and the latter has no link to growth. Based on both macro- and micro-level investigations that test the link between {NPS} and firm growth and {NPS} and customer behaviour metrics respectively, our research finds that neither of these claims are supported.Journal of Database Marketing \& Customer Strategy Management (2008) 15, 79–90. doi:10.1057/dbm.2008.4; published online 12 May 2008 [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Purpose – Too often top management focuses primarily on inputs and outputs of the firm, but has little daily information about whether customers are being frustrated, satisfied or delighted. However, one of the most critical pieces of information about the future health of an organization concerns the results of what the firm does for its customers, are they delighted or frustrated? This paper aims to address this issue.Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses six tools that can measure how well the firm is delivering customer value and satisfaction.Findings – The measurement of outcomes and customer delight thus requires more than the adoption of a new set of terminologies and tools. It is a different way of thinking, speaking and acting in the workplace.Practical implications – Ultimately the tools and the methodologies are less important than the internal conversations surrounding them. This dialog enables the managers and the people doing the work to get inside the mind of customers and focus on what might delight them, and to track whether that is being accomplished.Originality/value – For those organizations that are learning to thrive in the new era of customer capitalism and have committed themselves to delighting their customers, tools like Net Promoter Score, user stories, value stream and cycle time measurement and social media offer the possibility of seeing what is happening to customer outcomes in real time.

	abstract = {The American Customer Satisfaction Index ({ACSI}) is a new type of market-based performance measure for firms, industries, economic sectors, and national economies. The authors discuss the nature and purpose of {ACSI} and explain the theory underlying the {ACSI} model, the nation-wide survey methodology used to collect the data, and the econometric approach employed to estimate the indices. They also illustrate the use of {ACSI} in conducting benchmarking studies, both cross-sectionally and over time. The authors find customer satisfaction to be greater for goods than for services and, in turn, greater for services than for government agencies, as well as find cause for concern in the observation that customer satisfaction in the United States is declining, primarily because of decreasing satisfaction with services. The authors estimate the model for the seven major economic sectors for which data are collected. Highlights of the findings include that (1) customization is more important than reliability in determining customer satisfaction, (2) customer expectations play a greater role in sectors in which variance in production and consumption is relatively low, and (3) customer satisfaction is more quality-driven than value- or price-driven. The authors conclude with a discussion of the implications of {ACSI} for public policymakers, managers, consumers, and marketing in general. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	title = {Linking Customer Loyalty to Growth},
	volume = {49},
	issn = {15329194},
	abstract = {In recent years, researchers and consultants have advanced a number of customer metrics to explain the connections between customer behavior and growth. But these efforts have generated more smoke than heat. Despite claims to the contrary, the authors argue that the most popular metrics have shown only modest correlations to growth. None of them have shown themselves to be universally effective across all competitive environments. Early customer metrics tried to explain why people buy. To many companies, it came down to marketing. Yet, as the authors explain, the issues that affect customer loyalty are complex and go beyond standard marketing. This gave rise to a new category of metrics aimed at understanding the customer experience. Although managers have learned a lot about the components of service quality (including reliability, responsiveness and empathy), the approach doesn't point managers to specific actions they can take. Beginning in the 1990s, many managers began paying closer attention to customer retention -- in particular, understanding what makes for dissatisfaction and satisfaction. But as the authors note, the linkages among satisfaction, customer behavior and positive financial outcomes have been modest. Today's most popular metric, the Net Promoter Score, focuses on how customer word of mouth -- both negative and positive -- can advance growth. Developed by Bain \& Company Inc. consultant Fred Reichheld, it claims the ability to predict future growth from customer replies to one question: "How likely is it that you would recommend this company to a friend or colleague?" The authors found that the linkage between the Net Promoter Score and subsequent customer behavior was modest at best; models based on multiple variables consistently outperformed models based on Net Performer. The authors are skeptical that there can be a single metric that reduces complex, multifaceted constructs to one or two dimensions; if there is, they write, "there's a good chance it will ignore one or more important aspects of the equation."

	abstract = {abstract How do we know if an economy is performing well? How do we know if a company is performing well? The fact is that we have serious difficulty answering these questions today. The economy--for nations and for corporations--has changed much more than our theories and measurements. The development of national customer satisfaction indices ({NCSIs}) represents an important step towards addressing the gap between what we know and what we need to know. This paper describes the methodology underlying one such measure, the American Customer Satisfaction Index ({ACSI}). {ACSI} represents a uniform system for evaluating, comparing, and-ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction across firms, industries and nations. Other nations are now adopting the same approach. It is argued that a global network of {NCSIs} based on a common methodology is not simply desirable, but imperative. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

An effective service-quality information system offers a company's executives a larger view of service quality along with a composite of many smaller pictures. It teaches decision makers which service attributes are important to customers and prospects, what parts of the firm's service system are working well or breaking down, and which service investments are paying off. A service-quality information system does not replace the need for managers to interact directly with customers.

Results from a multicompany empirical study examining relationships from the model concerning customers' behavioral intentions show strong evidence of their being influenced by service quality. The findings also reveal differences in the nature of the quality-intentions link across different dimensions of behavioral intentions. The authors' discussion centers on ways the results and research approach of their study can be helpful to researchers and managers. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Research has shown that an increase in perceived crowding in a retail store (created from either human or spatial density) can decrease the level of satisfaction that shoppers have with the store. The three studies reported here examine the retail crowding-satisfaction relationship to determine the extent to which it is a simple, direct relationship. Specifically, we consider the possibility that the crowding satisfaction relationship is mediated by emotional reactions that are experienced while shopping. In addition, moderating variables such as prior expectations of crowding, tolerance for crowding, and store type are examined for their influence on the crowding -satisfaction relationship. The results of two field studies indicate that whereas emotions only partially mediate the relationship, the decrease in shopping satisfaction due to crowding is moderated by expectations of crowding and personal tolerance for crowding. A laboratory experiment replicated the field studies and shows, in addition, that although ceiling and floor effects may be present, the relationship between perceived crowding and shopping satisfaction appears to vary by store type.

	abstract = {Purpose--The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between parent satisfaction and child retention at a childcare provider. Design/methodology/approach--The survey data used in the analyses involves a sample size of 1,003 respondents, all clients of a regional childcare provider in the {USA}. Logistic regression was used to test the propositions. Findings--The results indicate that parent satisfaction is most important to child retention when the child is very young (birth to one year of age). As children increase in age, however, parent satisfaction becomes increasingly less predictive of children's continued enrollment at a childcare facility. Research limitations/implications--One of the limitations of this research is that it tests the propositions within a single firm. Future research should attempt to replicate these findings across several childcare providers. Practical implications--Emphasizing improvements in different attributes for different age groups has implications for increasing retention for childcare providers, in addition to ultimately increasing the satisfaction of parents. Originality/value--While all would agree that childcare services are of extremely high importance (at both a national and individual level), no research to date has examined the role of parent satisfaction to the continued enrollment of a child at a childcare facility. Our findings show that the presumed relationship between satisfaction and retention varies greatly by the age of child. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	volume = {11},
	abstract = {Prior research suggests that perceived performance of a product or a service is directly linked to postpurchase satisfaction. We argue that this causal relationship might be a measurement artifact and/or insufficient modeling of the satisfaction process rather than an accurate assessment of how consumers form satisfaction judgments. To test our hypotheses, a 2 × 2 × 2 (Performance × Expectations × Needs) factorial design was used with 2 types of perceived performance measures (value-laden and objective). The findings demonstrate that the observed direct link from perceived performance to overall satisfaction diminishes when more objective perceived performance indicators replace the commonly used value-laden measures. Furthermore, desire-congruency was found to contribute independently to satisfaction over and above a disconfirmation-of-expectations standard. In fact, desire-congruency was found to be a better predictor of satisfaction than disconfirmation-of-expectations. Finally, our results suggest that the direct performance-satisfaction link becomes insignificant when the modeling of the satisfaction process is improved. Taken together, these findings support the view that the frequently observed high correlations between perceived performance and satisfaction might be a reflection of the type of measures used and/or insufficient capturing of the evaluative process leading to satisfaction, rather than support for a direct causal link.

	abstract = {An estimated 190 million people are now living outside their countries of birth or citizenship, and the rate of this migration is expected to remain high. The resulting growing cultural and ethnic diversity in societies adds specific challenges to the requirement of delivering public services such as health care to consumers. Globally, about half of the migrant population are women. Migrants’ outcomes of pregnancy are known to be poor, showing significant disparities when compared with those of native populations. Although these disparities have been noted, knowledge is limited regarding the availability and accessibility of healthcare services, as well as the acceptability of maternity care for women with experiences of free and forced migration. Healthcare research in general, and maternity care research specifically, have often neglected this population. This paper examines the existing international guidelines intended to address inequities in health outcomes, policies which have been introduced at national levels, and the widely used concepts of ‘patient-centred’ and ‘woman-centred’ health services. The ideals implicit in those guidelines and concepts are contrasted with the available evidence of many overseas nationals’ experiences with healthcare provisions in general, and maternity care in particular. This is followed by reflections on deficiencies in current studies and on those methodological problems which make research on maternity care for migrant women particularly challenging. The conclusion considers the appropriateness and relevance of guidelines currently promoting equity in maternity care and suggests a future agenda for priority research. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Based on perceptions of inputs and outcomes of buyer, dealer, and salesperson, two subtractive versions of the equity formula--absolute equity difference and equity advantage--were tested with fairness and preference as mediating variables. Both variables were related only to the equity advantage formula, and disconfirmation and fairness were shown to be distinct components of post-transaction dispositions. Moreover, product satisfaction was shown to be a function of product disconfirmation, complaining, and satisfaction with the dealer. The latter apparently mediates both fairness and salesperson satisfaction. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

As macro-level customer satisfaction data were not available until recently, researchers have only taken first steps towards analysing economic determinants of customer satisfaction. Based on a more complex conceptual framework and on data from Germany and Japan, this article examines how economic processes influence the perceived value of goods and services, quality expectations and customer satisfaction. Using principal component analysis, regression analysis and structural equation modelling, this study finds that perceived value is positively influenced by both economic growth and lagged economic expectations. Customer satisfaction is positively influenced by economic growth and negatively by current economic expectations, with half of the impact mediated by perceived value. Economic expectations positively influence expectations regarding the quality of goods and services. These results imply that consumer researchers should no longer ignore economic influences on consumer attitudes. Marketing managers are advised to be cautious not to misinterpret economic-induced variations in customer satisfaction as caused by corporate performance. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Parallel to the exponential growth of e-commerce, this issue needs to be revisited with respect to the Internet due to its uniqueness compared with traditional retailing channels. This study employs depth-interviews with Web developers to address this issue. The findings suggest that .com satisfaction and .com dissatisfaction are partially, but not completely independent; just as they are partially, but not completely equal and opposite.

Results showed that at the purchase stage, the three variables, found significantly related to {CS}/D at purchase for {US} consumers, were also significant for Korean consumers. These three at-purchase variables were: perceived at-purchase performance, performance expectation and experience-based norm disconfirmation (i.e. the discrepancy between consumers' experience-based norm and their perception of product performance at purchase). When the variables related to {CS}/D at the product-consumption stage were examined, both similarities and differences were found between Korean and {US} consumers. For both countries, perceived consumption performance and satisfaction at purchase were significantly related to {CS}/D at the productconsumption stage. Differences were found in the effects of expectancy disconfirmation and performance expectation on {CS}/D at the product-consumption stage. Expectancy disconfirmation is the discrepancy between consumers' performance expectation and their perception of product performance after consumption. Expectancy expectation was found to be a significant determinant of {CS}/D for {US} consumers, but was not a determinant for Korean consumers. Performance expectation, which was found not to be a significant determinant of {CS}/D for {US} consumers, was a significant determinant for Korean consumers. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

The psychological traits examined are need for social affiliation, consumer relationship proneness and need for variety. Using partial least squares analysis ({PLS}), the results indicate that the perception of relational benefits leads to a higher satisfaction and passive loyalty. Need for social affiliation is a strong determinant of relational benefits, active loyalty and consumer relationship proneness. This latter trait influences the perception of relational benefits along with passive loyalty. Need for variety has a direct negative influence on consumer relationship proneness.

Hypotheses are developed and tested in a sample of 765 clients of a large German energy provider.

This research also takes the important integrative step of understanding the consumer behavioural constructs of consumer satisfaction. Although researchers have focused on the antecedents of consumer satisfaction, our integrative model has extended the outcomes of consumer behaviour on consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, this model strongly suggests a positive view of the inter-relationships between the antecedent variables and outcome variables of satisfaction. In particular, our model is not consistent with Oliver's attribution models in which satisfaction is a consequence of attribution processing. All hypothesized variables were supported by our empirical study. The findings present a variety of guides to formulating marketing strategies for both practitioners and academics.

Moreover, the direct and indirect effects of values and involvement on purchase intentions were studied. The study utilized the survey questionnaire and used sport shoes as the product being researched. The sample consisted of 197 students who responded to an anonymous questionnaire. Five hypotheses were tested and four of them were confirmed by the data. Perceived quality had a direct and an indirect effect (through overall satisfaction) on purchase intentions, overall satisfaction had a direct effect on purchase intentions and involvement had an indirect effect on purchase intentions through overall satisfaction and perceived quality. The results of the study provide several theoretical and practical implications. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Developing economies offer tremendous potential for future growth and organizations appreciating these consumers’ requirements stand to reap considerable returns. However, compared with more developed economies published consumer studies are few. In particular, there is a dearth of service quality research and hardly any from Africa. Furthermore, the little available research tends to apply Western methodologies, which may not be entirely appropriate. This research investigates East African consumer perceptions of retail banking using an approach that takes account of the research context. Qualitative research was undertaken to define the relevant service attributes. Performance along these was then investigated through a survey with over 2000 respondents. Principal component analysis identifies 13 core service dimensions and multinomial logistic regression reveals which are the key drivers of customer satisfaction. Comparison of the results with studies from other regions confirms that established standardized research instruments are likely to miss or under-represent service attributes important in developing countries.

	abstract = {How do preferences change when consumers focus on the anticipated satisfaction with a purchase rather than choice? In a series of three studies, we show that preferences, both expressed and revealed, change depending on the degree to which anticipated satisfaction is evoked. These shifts in preferences arise because, compared to choice, anticipated satisfaction elicits a mental-imaging processing strategy that is both more effort intensive and qualitatively different. By providing direct evidence from thought protocols and by presenting evidence suggesting that these shifts in preferences vanish when mental imagery is discouraged or made more difficult, we show that the effect arises out of a processing strategy that requires effortful mental imagery of one or more of the options in the decision-making task. Finally, we demonstrate the uniqueness of the effect by showing that it cannot be generated with heightened processing or by an orientation that is directed toward the extent to which the options are liked.

	abstract = {Evidence which demonstrates a link between the affective dimension and satisfaction in a tangible product based context is well documented. However, when placed in a credence service context the role of Affect becomes more complex. Previous research in this field has assumed consumer homogeneity when there is increasing evidence of consumer heterogeneity. This research attempts to address this by examining affective reactions to service encounters between two groups of respondents, one with the ability to make performance assessments about the service and one without. Findings suggest consumers of differing sophistication will vary in the way they form expectation and performance assessments about the technical, functional and affective components of credence services and that consumer sophistication may have a moderating influence on affective reactions evoked. This in turn has implications for the design and delivery of service offerings within such contexts. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Building on the valence-expectancy framework, we find that disconfirmation and attributions impact satisfaction in a complex manner. Besides its main effect, responsibility moderates disconfirmation's effect on satisfaction, manifested as a two-way interaction between the two. Disconfirmation and responsibility jointly determine the valence component, and stability determines the expectancy component of the satisfaction evaluation. This is consistent with the three-way interaction among stability, responsibility, and disconfirmation that we also find. These results clarify past studies and provide new insights about the relationship among the constructs. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

A review of the related literatures in job, health (patient), marital, and life satisfaction reveals that varying degrees of methodological rigor have been used to develop satisfaction measures, resulting in instruments as long as 80 items, but that little consensus on conceptual or measurement issues is evident. In an attempt to further satisfaction measurement in the consumer domain, a number of suggested multi-disciplinary approaches were combined in a two-product satisfaction instrument to test for response characteristics, reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity. Results in two separate pilot samples indicate that the highest reliabilities were achieved with semantic differential and Likert scales. These measures along with other verbal and graphic rating scales also demonstrated a high level of convergence and acceptable levels of discriminability. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

The results of two scenario-based experiments suggest that conflict management style impacts customer satisfaction with service recovery efforts. Additionally, pre-existing attitude toward the company influences the customer''s interpretation of a service provider''s conflict management style. Those with positive attitudes respond favorably to a cooperative approach in the face of service failures. Conflict management style has little impact on those with negative pre-existing attitudes. A cooperative recovery style and exceeding expectations is necessary to satisfy customers. These results highlight the gravity of service failures, and the importance of proper training in dealing with service recovery. [Copyright \&y\& Elsevier]

	abstract = {The present empirically examined customer satisfaction with Internet sites that vary in the opportunity for mass customization. The expectation-disconfirmation model was used as a theatrical framework of the study. Two children's apparel sites were developed as the stimuli: one with a mid level of interactivity and the other with a high level of interactivity, for selection of clothing design options. The data from 208 respondents were analyzed using {LISREL} 8.72. The finding indicates that both consumers' expectations and perceived performances for the mass customized sites included positive and negative aspects. The results suggest that expectations were not a significant predictor of satisfaction for this innovative shopping experience yet satisfaction was primarily driven by the performance of the site and predicted by disconfirmation of expectations. The findings also suggest that expectations are not related to performance perceptions, possibly due to consumers' lack of familiarity with mass customization. The more interactive site yielded the more positive performance as well as overall positive satisfaction. Nevertheless, the less interactive site, which offers fewer choices than more interactive site, yielded more positive behavioural consequences. The generalization of the results of this study is limited because of lack of random sampling and use of the mock site of children's apparel product category. However, useful theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Presumably, information overload causes decreased satisfaction and reducing information overload would increase satisfaction. Building on Unconscious Thought Theory, results suggest that this classic effect reverses when consumers do not deliberate. Consumers reported lower satisfaction with a praline chosen from a large assortment than from a small one, when they either deliberated intensively or chose spontaneously. This effect reversed when consumers were distracted before choosing. Unconscious thinking about a large assortment led to the highest product satisfaction. [Copyright \&y\& Elsevier]

Purchase importance plays a role in pre-purchase process, yet little is known about how it may influence customer satisfaction formation process and loyalty intentions. This study examines the moderating effect of purchase importance in the customer satisfaction formation process and in loyalty intentions. A survey was conducted with customers in a restaurant setting, and structural equation analysis via {LISREL} was performed. The results show that perceived performance has a stronger influence on satisfaction when purchase importance is low, whereas satisfaction seems to be influenced both by disconfirmation and perceived performance when purchase importance is high. Post-consumption expectations were found to influence on loyalty intentions under both high and low importance purchase conditions. The implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are made. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Sixty-two car users voluntarily travelled by public transport for a period of one month and ratings of predicted, on-line experienced and remembered satisfaction were collected. The results showed that remembered satisfaction with public transport was significantly lower than on-line experienced satisfaction. Furthermore, overall remembered satisfaction accounted for current public transport use, whereas on-line experienced satisfaction did not. Results suggest that recollection of satisfaction with public transport is negatively biased. This bias affects current choice to travel by public transport. [Copyright \&y\& Elsevier]

But could two of these factors-specifically, trait competitiveness and working long hours-actually be associated with counterproductive sales behavior? This research examines the effect of trait competitiveness, hours worked, and person-organization fit on the three forms of deviant salesperson behavior (organizational deviance, interpersonal deviance, and frontline deviance) and, in addition to testing these main effects, investigates whether managers can attenuate these relationships by investing time explaining the meaningfulness of the salesperson's job to the salesperson. Using survey data collected from 160 business-to-business salespeople from multiple companies and multiple industries, results support five of seven hypothesized main effects as well as three of four hypothesized interactions.

Using a qualitative study involving 22 in-depth interviews with {FLEs}, the analysis reveals three categories of {COD} behaviours: deviant service adaptation ({DSA}), deviant service communication ({DSC}), and deviant use of resources ({DUR}). The drivers of {COD} are categorised as individual (risk-taking, service aptitude, and pro-social moral values), situational (resource availability, social capita with customers, legitimacy of customer problems, and avoidance of hassles), and organisational (unconducive service climate and anticipated rewards). This paper contributes to understanding how and why {FLEs} over-service customers and extends current research by exploring multiple categories of behaviours within a services marketing context.},

	abstract = {Executives argue intuitively that trust is critical to effective organizational performance. Although articulated as a cognitive/ affective property ofindividuals, the collective effect of events influencing(and being influenced by) trust judgments must certainly impact organizational behavior. To begin to explore this, we conducted a simulation study of trust and organizational performance. Specifically, we defined a set ofcomputational agents, each with a trust function capable of evaluating the quality ofadvice from the other agents, and rendering judgments on the trustworthiness of the communicating agent. As agent judgments impact subsequent choices to accept or to generate communications, organizational performance is influenced. We manipulated two agent properties(trustworthiness, benevolence), two organizational variables (group size, group homogeneity/liar-to-honest ratio), and one environmental variable (stable, unstable). Results indicate that in homogeneous groups, honest groups did better than groups of liars, but under environmental instability, benevolent groups did worse. Under all conditions for heterogeneous groups, it only took one to three liars to degrade organizational performance.},

If so, they should vary strategically with manipulations of mating-related motives. The authors examined this possibility in 4 experiments. Inducing mating goals in men increased their willingness to spend on conspicuous luxuries but not on basic necessities. In women, mating goals boosted public--but not private--helping. Although mating motivation did not generally inspire helping in men, it did induce more helpfulness in contexts in which they could display heroism or dominance. Conversely, although mating motivation did not lead women to conspicuously consume, it did lead women to spend more publicly on helpful causes. Overall, romantic motives seem to produce highly strategic and sex-specific self-presentations best understood within a costly signaling framework.},

The authors tested the model with a sample of U.S. importers who buy from foreign exporters. The results indicate that the importers' commitment to the relationship significantly influenced its benevolence; however, importers' satisfaction with the relationship did not significantly affect their benevolence. Importers' altruistic benevolence had a positive impact on performance in mature relationships but not in new relationships. Importers' mutualistic benevolence had a significant influence on performance regardless of relationship duration.},

This paper proposes two additional limiting case models--perfect benevolence and perfect malevolence--as alternative ideal descriptions. Insights from the three ideal models are then used to develop a more general model with less restrictive assumptions based on four variables: degree of monopoly, degree of explicitness, identification, and terms of exchange.

As expected, both benevolent and hostile sexism predicted attitudes toward elective abortion, but only benevolent sexism predicted attitudes toward traumatic abortion.

If any of the bids is preferred to all others in a pairwise comparison (i.e., a Condorcet winner exists) then this proposal is implemented. If such a bid does not exist then an equal split of the benefit is assumed. An equilibrium of this game is for each player to suggest that one of the opponents should receive the lion’s share of the benefit, even though each player cares only about his own share. We call this phenomenon “rational benevolence”. Although the end that is desired by the players is purely egoistic, the means of achieving it may be perceived as benevolent.

L'étude réalisée dans le secteur bancaire (N = 1999) montre que : 1) l'engagement calculé qui s'accroît dans le temps nuit à l'établissement d'un échange relationnel ; 2) sur le long terme, la confiance du client a généralement un rôle décroissant alors que l'engagement affectif devient prépondérant dans l'échange relationnel ; 3) la bienveillance des personnels en contact encourage -- via un effet de réciprocité -- une plus grande bienveillance des clients, et ceci d'autant plus que leur vulnérabilité est forte ; 4) la crédibilité des personnels en contact produit au contraire des effets de contraste et conduit les clients monogames à des intentions négatives. Des implications pour la gestion de la relation client (anciens / nouveaux, mono / multi) sont soulignées. (French)},

The results indicate that tourists develop a set of beliefs that comfort them in the certainty that the touristic destination will fulfil their expectations: the presumption of benevolence, credibility and integrity attributed to a tourist destination. Only the benevolence and credibility presumptions influence the commitment towards touristic destinations. In the same way, getting attitudes on the altruistic motivations of the touristic destination (benevolence) brings more guarantees to tourism than those consisting of the know-how (credibility). The results indicate the sources of trust and commitment and the way by which the actors associated to marketing of touristic destination can achieve it. This study confirms the existence of tourists inclined towards creating long-lasting relationships with their touristic destinations.

This study defines and conceptualizes employee and customer empathy as multidimensional constructs and empirically investigates their impact on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. A quantitative study based on dyadic data and a multilevel modeling approach finds support for two effects of empathy in service interactions. The study reveals that customer empathy strengthens the positive effect of employee empathy on customer satisfaction, leading to more “symbiotic interactions.” The findings also indicate that empathic customers are more likely to respond to a dissatisfying encounter with “forgiveness,” in the sense that customer empathy is able to mitigate negative effects of customer dissatisfaction on customer loyalty. From these empirical results, the authors derive several implications for service research and the management of service encounters. In particular, the present study provides a valuable basis for strategies of “interaction routing,” that is, matching customers and employees on the basis of their psychological profiles to create smooth and satisfying service interactions. The authors elaborate on approaches to implement this strategy in service organizations.},

Still, our knowledge about the correlates of trust in media is limited. Only a few studies have utilized a correlational design to explore the associations between trust in media and other factors, and almost all of these studies originate in the U.S. context. The current investigation utilizes data from 44 diverse countries (n = 57,847), collected as part of the World Values Survey, to broaden our understanding of trust in media. The aim is two-fold—to learn about individual-level correlates across contexts and to demonstrate that macro-level factors play a part in shaping such trust. Our findings indicate that levels of political interest, interpersonal trust, and exposure to television news and newspapers are positively correlated with trust in media, while education and exposure to news on the Internet are negatively associated. On the macro level, postmaterialism emerged as a consistent predictor of trust in media. State ownership of the media industry did not have a main effect on trust in media after controlling for other factors. However, an interaction was found between state ownership and level of democracy: state ownership of television is positively associated with media trust in democratic societies and negatively associated with trust in media in nondemocratic societies.},

Are collective patterns of user behavior under conditions of shared attention distinct from other "bursts" of activity like breaking news events? Using data from a population of approximately 200,000 politically-active Twitter users, we compare features of their behavior during eight major events during the 2012 U.S. presidential election to examine (1) the impact of "media events" have on patterns of social media use compared to "typical" time and (2) whether changes during media events are attributable to changes in behavior across the entire population or an artifact of changes in elite users' behavior. Our findings suggest that while this population became more active during media events, this additional activity reflects concentrated attention to a handful of users, hashtags, and tweets. Our work is the first study on distinguishing patterns of large-scale social behavior under condition of uncertainty and shared attention, suggesting new ways of mining information from social media to support collective sensemaking following major events.},

Partial Least Squares serves to determine direct, mediated and moderating effects. Findings confirm that the more favourable the perceived reputation, the less likely customers are to attribute negative motives for the price increase or price unfairness. A larger price increase does not diminish the impact reputation has on perceived price fairness or on purchase intentions. Reputation also has an effect on anger mediated by price fairness.

Findings, derived from a multimethod investigation, show that communities can preserve continuity even when heterogeneity operates as a destabilizing force. Continuity preserves when community members depend on each other for social and economic resources: a dependency that promotes the use of frame alignment practices. These practices enable the community to (re)stabilize, reproduce, and reform over time. The authors also highlight the overlapping roles of consumers and producers and develop a dimensional characterization of communities that helps bridge prior research on brand communities, consumption subcultures, and consumer tribes.},

The basic idea is to let parties rate each other, for example after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated ratings about a given party to derive a trust or reputation score, which can assist other parties in deciding whether or not to transact with that party in the future. A natural side effect is that it also provides an incentive for good behaviour, and therefore tends to have a positive effect on market quality. Reputation systems can be called collaborative sanctioning systems to reflect their collaborative nature, and are related to collaborative filtering systems. Reputation systems are already being used in successful commercial online applications. There is also a rapidly growing literature around trust and reputation systems, but unfortunately this activity is not very coherent. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of existing and proposed systems that can be used to derive measures of trust and reputation for Internet transactions, to analyse the current trends and developments in this area, and to propose a research agenda for trust and reputation systems.},

	abstract = {Next generation Web 2.0 communities and distributed P2P systems rely on the cooperation of diverse user populations spread across numerous administrative and security domains. Zero accountability via anonymous online identities and divergent interests result in selfish behavior that can disrupt or manipulate networks for personal gain. While 'reputation systems' are recognized as a promising means to establish social control for such communities, developing reliable reputation systems remains a challenge. Several unaddressed threats still limit the effectiveness of reputation systems. Furthermore, most existing work on reputations has focused on accurate reputations for stable systems, but not examined the implications of integrating user reputations into scalable distributed infrastructures. The primary goal of this paper is to investigate and address the critical open challenges that limit the effectiveness of reputations. First, we identify a thorough taxonomy on reputation management, and use it as our framework to classify adversarial threats that compromise reliable operation of reputation systems. Second, we survey existing research to address these threats. Finally, we present our solutions to address the two leading reasons for erroneous and misleading values produced by reputation systems today, i.e., user collusion and short-lived online identities. We believe that this paper not only serves as an introduction to reputation systems design, but will also help researchers deploy reliable reputation solutions that contribute towards improving the performance of large distributed applications.},

The results of two experimental studies of {eBay} users show that trustworthiness judgments are influenced by the text comments accompanying negative feedback and also by whether a trust violation is perceived as competence-based or morality-based. Plain apologies were more successful than denials in repairing trust. These effects were mediated by the perceived believability of the comments. Thus, to avoid the detrimental effect of noise on trust, operators of on-line marketplaces should encourage text feedback comments and reactions.},

	title = {Feedback Mechanisms, Judgment Bias, and Trust Formation in Online Auctions},
	volume = {42},
	issn = {00117315},
	abstract = {Online markets, like {eBay}, Amazon, and others rely on electronic reputation or feedback systems to curtail adverse selection and moral hazard risks and promote trust among participants in the marketplace. These systems are based on the idea that providing information about a trader's past behavior (performance on previous market transactions) allows market participants to form judgments regarding the trustworthiness of potential interlocutors in the marketplace. It is often assumed, however, that traders correctly process the data presented by these systems when updating their initial beliefs. In this article, we demonstrate that this assumption does not hold. Using a controlled laboratory experiment simulating an online auction site with 127 participants acting as buyers, we find that participants interpret seller feedback information in a biased (non-Bayesian) fashion, overemphasizing the compositional strength (i.e., the proportion of positive ratings) of the reputational information and underemphasizing the weight (predictive validity) of the evidence as represented by the total number of transactions rated. Significantly, we also find that the degree to which buyers misweigh seller feedback information is moderated by the presentation format of the feedback system as well as attitudinal and psychological attributes of the buyer. Specifically, we find that buyers process feedback data presented in an Amazon-like format-a format that more prominently emphasizes the strength dimension of feedback information-in a more biased (less-Bayesian) manner than identical ratings data presented using an {eBay}-like format. We further find that participants with greater institution-based trust (i.e., structural assurance) and prior online shopping experience interpreted feedback data in a more biased (less-Bayesian) manner. The implications of these findings for both research and practice are discussed.},

Prior research argues that consumers form enduring and strong attachments to possessions because of their centrality to identity projects. This role is heightened in life transitions including cross-border movements as possessions anchor consumer's identities either to their homeland or to the host country. This study reexamines this claim via in-depth interviews with elite global nomads, deterritorialized consumers who engage in serial relocation and frequent short-term international mobility. An alternative relationship to possessions characterized by detachment and flexibility emerges, which is termed "liquid." Three characteristics of a liquid relationship to possessions are identified: temporary situational value, use-value, and immateriality. The study outlines a logic of nomadic consumption, that of instrumentality, where possessions and practices are strategic resources in managing mobility. A liquid perspective on possessions expands current understandings of materiality, acculturation, and globalization.},

Access-based consumption is examined in the context of car sharing via an interpretive study of Zipcar consumers. Four outcomes of these dimensions in the context of car sharing are identified: lack of identification, varying significance of use and sign value, negative reciprocity resulting in a big-brother model of governance, and a deterrence of brand community.

Drawing on the consumption community and co-creation literature, this paper reports on a study that examines the nature and characteristics of a virtual co-creation context. Findings suggest consumers are able to take ownership, define and create their own post-product consumption experience, and, through a collaborative - often implicit - process between firm and consumer, continually modify and co-evolve' the product in an ongoing and iterative process. This in turn has implications for post-product ownership within such contexts.},

	title = {The Impact of Customer Loyalty and Loyalty Programs: Regulatory Focus, Chronic Reactance, and Consumer Reward Choices in Loyalty Programs},
	volume = {22},
	shorttitle = {The Impact of Customer Loyalty and Loyalty Programs},
	abstract = {Loyalty programs have become one of the most widely used customer relationship management ({CRM}) tools over the past decade (Kivetz and Simonson 2003). While such programs aim to ensure customer loyalty by rewarding consumers for repeat purchases with a firm, the debate on their effectiveness still persists (Bolton, Kannan, and Bramlett 2000; Liu 2007). As such, there is a greater need to investigate the various factors that may influence the success of loyalty programs. Although the impact of different program-related variables such as effort requirements (e.g., Kivetz and Simonson 2002) and rewards (e.g., Kivetz 2005) has been analyzed broadly, research investigating the effect of consumer characteristics on loyalty program success remains scarce (Liu and Yang 2009). Nevertheless, as this research posits, the effectiveness of loyalty reward programs may also depend on the subtle individual differences in motivational orientation that shape consumer reactance toward such programs. The purpose of the current research is to provide a regulatory focus and reactance interpretation of the specific choice and loyalty behavior exhibited by consumers involved in loyalty reward programs. Building on the motivational hierarchy perspective of the 3M Model (Mowen 2000), the study introduces a conceptual framework that examines the hierarchical interrelationships among consumer regulatory focus, chronic and situational reactance, reward choice, and loyalty behavior in a loyalty program context. In particular, the framework proposes that the different levels of reactance experienced by promotion- and prevention-focused consumers may determine their reward choices (effort-congruent vs. effort-incongruent) in a loyalty program. The regulatory fit state arising from these choices is, in turn, predicted to enhance subsequent loyalty behavior. Individuals experience psychological reactance when there is a threat to their freedom of choice (Brehm 1966). Marketing appeals such as loyalty programs are known to trigger situational reactance among consumers since individuals perceive them as an external attempt to control their future consumption choices. The magnitude of situ- ational reactance experienced by individuals is in part driven by their level of chronic reactance (Dillard and Shen 2007). Chronic reactance is a personality trait that refers to an individual's stable predisposition toward reactance across all situations (Hong and Faedda 1996). The present research suggests that individuals' chronic reactance levels may be influenced by their regulatory focus. According to cognitive tuning theory (Friedman and Forster 2002), promotion-focused individuals' sensitivity toward positive outcomes leads them to behave in an exploratory fashion and utilize eagerness means to approach gains. These individuals often seek variety by trying different choice alternatives. As such, their varietyseeking nature makes promotion-focused people exhibit higher levels of chronic reactance. In contrast, prevention-focused individuals' sensitivity toward negative outcomes leads them to act in a cautious manner and employ vigilance means to avoid mistakes. These individuals shun variety and are more reluctant to try different choice alternatives. Hence, prevention-focused people are expected to display lower levels of chronic reactance as a result of their variety-avoiding tendency. Moreover, consistent with their higher chronic reactance levels, promotion-focused consumers are also predicted to express stronger situational reactance toward loyalty programs compared to prevention-focused consumers. We expect promotion-focused consumers to choose loyalty programs that offer effort-congruent (vs. effort-incongruent) rewards in order to alleviate their situational reactance toward such incentives. This is because effort-congruent rewards do not provide a salient extrinsic reason for consumers to exhibit specific consumption behaviors. Therefore, consumers believe that their behavior is not influenced by effort-congruent rewards and do not perceive them as a threat to their freedom of choice. On the other hand, we expect prevention-focused consumers to select loyalty programs that offer effort-incongruent (vs. effort-congruent) rewards. Unlike promotion-focused consumers, these individuals do not face the need to reduce their situational reactance by choosing effort congruent rewards. Furthermore, consumers are proposed to experience regulatory fit when they join loyalty programs that offer rewards that match their regulatory focus. The "value from fit" is then predicted to translate into more favorable evaluations of the loyalty program and stronger loyalty behavior by consumers. From a theoretical perspective, this research contributes to the loyalty program literature by introducing consumer regulatory focus as another intrinsic determinant of program success. In addition, the present study also has practical implications regarding the successful design and promotion of loyalty programs. As loyalty programs are an important {CRM} tool, they should be tailored to the unique psychological characteristics of individual customers (Kivetz and Simonson 2002). Hence, loyalty program marketers should obtain information on the specific psychographics of their target customers and utilize these valuable insights as bases for segmentation. Through such segmentation initiatives, marketers are more likely to offer loyalty rewards that fit the particular goal focus of their core customers. References are available upon request.},

Equally puzzling is the fact that these customers also have lower average lifetime with the firm. This leads us to a puzzle as to why these practices are widely prevalent in the industry. We find that loyalty cards provide value to the issuers in terms of risk management. They serve as a mechanism to reduce the risk associated with more profitable customers by attracting less risky customers. Thus, through loyalty cards the financial institution is able to balance out the total risk of the portfolio of customers by acquiring customers, who although less profitable, are less risky.},

While the preceding studies focused on specific firms or demographic regions as an empirical context, the scope of this study proposes that the generic influences underlying consumer behavior in retailer loyalty programs are transversal across firms or locations. A theoretical model of loyalty incorporating five latent variables (involvement, value, quality, commitment and loyalty) is developed and tested through structural equation modeling using empirical data collected from 122 respondents of various nationalities, all members of different global retailer programs. The fit of the model is satisfactory and confirms the positive influence of the study's constructs in creating behavioral loyalty. An important finding of the present study is that quality, value and commitment have equivalent direct effects on creating loyalty. Delivering quality is of prime importance as it has been found to drive both value and commitment, and it is proposed that retailers must focus on instilling commitment in their customers by using the equity theory. Future research may now validate these findings. One specific area would be to assess the psychographic characteristics of customers that determine their propensity to display high involvement in loyalty programs. This would have important implications for segmentation of markets for retailer loyalty programs.},

Recent analytical and empirical studies demonstrate inconsistent findings on the efficacy of loyalty programs in fulfilling these goals. In this study, an analytical model is developed to analyze the effect of customers’ valuation and their post-purchase satisfaction level on a loyalty program’s profitability. The results reveal how customers’ satisfaction plays a significant role in profitability of loyalty programs. We consider a profit-maximizing firm selling a good or service through two periods. Valuation is modeled as a deterministic parameter, as well as a stochastic variable with two arbitrary distributions. Depending on the customers’ valuation distribution, the model results in either a linear or a nonlinear optimization problem. Optimization problems are solved analytically, in terms of the model parameters. The obtained solutions provide some useful insights into the effects of customers’ satisfaction on the profitability of loyalty programs. Specifically, it is shown that depending on the customers’ satisfaction level, it may be optimal not to offer a loyalty reward.},

They find that after a retailer switched from a conventional {LP} to the {IBLP}, consumers became more responsive to reward point promotions than to price discounts of the same monetary value, were no longer responsive to competitors' reward point promotions, and exhibited stronger cumulative reward point effects. in addition, the new {LP} had a significantly different impact on 'current' {LP} members and nonmembers (defined by their status right before the switch), resulting in decreased (increased) total spending by the former (latter) group, under the retailer's current promotion practice. Furthermore, it is critically important for retailers to offer sufficient promotions under the new {LP} to achieve its full potential; otherwise, they risk alienating their loyal customers. Finally, the {IBLP} reduced attrition among existing customers and attracted more new customers, which contributed to most of the retailer's sales revenue gain after adopting the {IBLP}.},

Some of these variables have already been explored in the literature. Where our research breaks new ground is in establishing the difference between profiles of customers attracted by two of the most common types of loyalty programs currently used by grocery retail firms: a reward program and a loyalty card. The two kinds of program evidence differences in how they are managed, and we posit that the drivers of likelihood to take part in each are different. The study was carried out using logistic regression with a sample of 600 clients of a Spanish supermarket chain. Findings show that one particular type of customer is more likely to take part in these schemes: those displaying little shopping enjoyment, who are greatly concerned with privacy, and who show a favorable attitude toward loyalty programs in general. Furthermore, as expected, differences were observed between drivers of participation likelihood in reward programs and loyalty cards.},

Extant research has identified economic and psychological mechanism to understand how to improve the effectiveness of loyalty programs. Despite these achievements in the literature, a better understanding of how customer loyalty programs build customer loyalty to the company is still needed. One is how loyalty programs work through sociological mechanism to increase customer loyalty. The other is how program loyalty relates to company loyalty beyond the program loyalty. In this study, we investigate how sociological mechanism of loyalty programs (customer-company identification) works to enhance customer loyalty to a company. The results show that customer perceive benefits from a loyalty program can enhance customers' loyalty to that program itself directly (program loyalty) and loyalty to the company indirectly (company loyalty). The findings also show that developing customer-company identification is an important path to transform program loyalty to company loyalty which can reduce the company latent financial risk.},

	title = {The Impact of Customer Loyalty and Loyalty Programs: Not All Repeat Purchases Are the Same: Attitudinal Loyalty and Habit},
	volume = {22},
	shorttitle = {The Impact of Customer Loyalty and Loyalty Programs},
	abstract = {As marketing shifts to a relationship-oriented paradigm in the last 20 years, consumer loyalty has become one of the frontiers in marketing. In managing consumer loyalty, marketers often identify repeat customers based on their purchase frequency or spending level and draw the conclusion that all repeat customers are loyal. Academic research, however, suggests a much richer picture of consumer loyalty that encompasses things such as beliefs of product superiority, brand knowledge, and positive and accessible brand reactions (Kim, Morris, and Swait 2008). This divergence in approach highlights one of the oldest theoretical debates in the consumer loyalty literature -- the issue of how attitudinal and behavioral loyalty are related and which of the two is more suitable for understanding and managing brand and consumer relationships. It has been pointed out since more than 30 years ago that behavioral loyalty as reflected by repeat purchases does not adequately capture consumer loyalty (Jacoby and Kyner 1973). In particular, a consumer can repeat purchase either as a choice based on positive evaluations of a brand, or as an automatic process that is driven by contextual factors that have little if any to do with the brand/company per se (Huang and Yu 1999). As a result, using repeat purchases to define loyalty may contain noises that have little if anything to do with true loyalty. Realizing these issues with repeat purchase data, researchers have taken measures to account for the different drivers of behavioral loyalty. In modeling brand loyalty, for instance, mechanisms have been devised to take into account inertia and habit (Roy, Chintagunta, and Haldar 1996; Seetharaman and Chintagunta 1998). While incorporating such effects generally improves the explanatory power of a model, the theoretical origin of these effects is unclear. Recent advances in habit research, however, suggest an opportunity to bridge this gap and to integrate sound psychology theory into analyzing repeat purchase behavior. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to draw upon the habit literature to identify habit and attitudinal loyalty as two distinct drivers of behavioral loyalty as manifested by repeat purchases. More specifically, we argue that observed repatronage behavior can be driven by attitudinal loyalty as well as by habitual forces that are characterized by an automatic process. On surface, such habitual forces can result in repeat purchases even in the presence of competitive marketing actions, therefore, making it appear very similar to loyalty. However, when considering the effect of situational factors, habitual repeat purchase falls short of the loyalty test. To demonstrate the separate effects of loyalty and habit and the value of such an analysis, we conducted two empirical studies in the convenience store and the newspaper industries. In study 1, we analyzed actual purchase history of 198 consumers in a convenience store chain over the course of 12 months. Drawing from past research, we derived the habit strength based on these consumers' purchase behavior, and we further supplemented the data with these same consumers' self-reported attitudinal loyalty collected through a survey. Using a hierarchical linear model to take into account consumer heterogeneity, our results show that both attitudinal loyalty and habit had a significant positive impact on repeat purchase behavior. Furthermore, attitudinal loyalty and habit were only weakly correlated, suggesting that the behavioral manifestation of habit-driven repatronage is indeed distinctive and as a result can be separated from repeat purchases driven by attitudinal loyalty. In study 2, we conducted a field experiment to demonstrate the differential effects attitudinal loyalty and habit can have on consumer responses to marketing stimuli. We argue that, among high-repeat customers, consumers with strong habits and weak attitudinal loyalty will respond differently from consumers with weak habits but strong attitudinal loyalty. While existing studies have separately shown the effect of attitudinal loyalty and habit on behavioral loyalty, to our best knowledge, there has been no study that explicitly compares responses from attitudinally loyal versus habitual consumers. Using a market research study in the newspaper industry as the backdrop, we show that cost-effective incentive using brand-related rewards are more likely to be successful among attitudinally loyal customers than habitual customers. By showing that habitual vs. attitudinally loyal customers respond differently to marketing stimuli, our results confirm the practical value of differentiating between these two different drivers of repeat purchase and of segmenting and targeting consumers based on these drivers. Taken together, our research suggests that marketers can manage customer relationships more efficiently by identifying habitual vs. loyal customers using existing company data and by developing targeted marketing programs for these two different kinds of repeat customers. Currently we are planning a third study, which will examine the types of marketing stimuli that may be particularly effective for habitual consumers relative to attitudinally loyal consumers. Through these studies, we hope that we will provide theoretical richness to the action inertia phenomenon, and that combining the insights from consumer psychology and the modeling literature will yield a more complete understanding of consumer loyalty and consumer repatronage decisions.},

Therefore, our study intends to make two main contributions: (1) improving our understanding of the constructs 'program loyalty' and 'company loyalty', (2) investigating the relative impact of the two types of loyalty on preference, intention, and purchase behavior for the case of a multi-firm loyalty program. Results indicate that company loyalty influences a customer's choice to visit a particular provider and to prefer it over competitors, but it is not a strong predictor of purchase behavior. Conversely, program loyalty is a far more important driver of purchase behavior. This implies that company loyalty primarily attracts customers to a particular provider and program loyalty ensures that once inside the store, more money is spent.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Effectiveness of customers’ loyalty programs has been the focal point of some recent studies. While empirical research shows mixed findings, analytical studies on the efficacy of loyalty programs are in their early stages. In this paper, we develop an analytical model on the profitability of loyalty programs in which customers’ valuations along with their satisfaction levels are incorporated as stochastic variables. The model consists of a revenue-maximizing firm selling a product through two periods. A loyalty reward is offered to two-period buyers in the form of an absolute-value discount on the price in the second period. The satisfaction level is represented by the difference between a customer’s original and post-purchase valuation. The formulation yields a stochastic programming problem with a nonlinear non-convex objective function. The problem is solved in terms of the model parameters. The results reveal that depending on the mean and variance of the satisfaction levels, the firm may be better off not to offer a loyalty reward. Specifically, if the mean of satisfaction levels turns out to be positive with a coefficient of variation less than a certain threshold, not adopting the loyalty program is optimal.},

Findings – Customers with high elaboration rely more heavily on satisfaction than the {ZOT} to maintain customer loyalty. In addition, loyalty programs can decrease the effect of satisfaction on customer loyalty, but cannot increase the strength of the relationship between the {ZOT} and customer loyalty. Originality/value – This study is a preliminary attempt to integrate the {ZOT} and satisfaction in determining customer loyalty in a simultaneous model. The findings suggest that there is a trade-off between the effects of satisfaction and the {ZOT} on customer loyalty.

Children living in the poorest households are particularly disadvantaged.

Evidence that {CCM} programs can achieve equitable improvements in coverage is limited. This cross-sectional study uses a quasi-experimental design with intervention and comparison areas. Outcomes of a {CCM} program for malaria and diarrhoea operating in two districts of Cameroon were measured after 1 year of implementation. A household census (N = 16 954) provided measurement of treatment-seeking behaviour for recent episodes of fever and diarrhoea. Results were compared between areas using chi-square tests. Intervention-area children with fever or diarrhoea were nearly nine times more likely to receive treatment with artemisinin combination therapy or oral rehydration salts, respectively, vs neighbouring comparison-area children. High levels of effective treatment were equitable across socioeconomic status in intervention areas, whereas disparities were observed in neighbouring comparison areas. {CCM} can achieve rapid and equitable improvements in coverage of case management for malaria and diarrhoea, and is a promising strategy for achieving {MDG} 4. Improved access to treatment, quality of care and caregiver demand were achieved in two districts of Cameroon. {CCM} must be scaled up to demonstrate outcomes and impact at scale.},

Higher sales lead to a larger number of positive {OCRs}, and increased positive {OCRs} aid a brand's transition from weak to strong.

Real-time spending feedback stimulates budget shoppers to spend more (by buying more national brands). In contrast, this feedback leads nonbudget shoppers to spend less (by replacing national brands with store brands). Furthermore, smart shopping carts increase repatronage intentions for budget shoppers while keeping them stable for nonbudget shoppers.

Market concentration tends to increase when information on demand becomes publicly available. In addition, stochastic agglomeration caused by social influence decreases the predictability of market success. These heavily cited findings challenge traditional market research and provide important insights on the impact of social media and sales charts. We test the stability of their results by replicating the study on music demand in a slightly different setting. We further investigate the generalizability of findings by probing other product categories and different phases of purchase decisions, i.e., interest, consideration, and actual demand. Across all categories and across all dependent variables, we are able to replicate the direction of the effects. We do, however, consistently obtain smaller effect sizes than reported in the original paper.},

Many firms assume that customers like to feel special and to receive discretionary preferential treatments ({DPT}). This research argues that the reality is more complicated: the same preferential treatment may delight one customer but enrage or embarrass another. To help companies align their {DPT} with their customers' preferences, this article identifies four dimensions along which consumers positively or negatively evaluate {DPT}: justification, imposition, visibility, and surprise. This article then introduces customer heterogeneity in the form of two individual traits that moderate {DPT} evaluations. Through two studies, the article shows that distinction seekers prefer visible rewards that impose on other customers, but negotiators prefer unjustified, non-surprising privileges. Finally, by tying consumer preferences to two readily available variables (age and gender), this article concludes with a set of practical guidelines for the companies that hope to align their {DPT} strategy with customer profiles.},

Design/methodology/approach – The authors' panel dataset is compiled from Amazon.com's book section and uses publicly available information about reviewers in combination with the reviews they wrote. The authors utilize the Pareto/{NBD} model with time-invariant covariates. The model's parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimates ({MLE}) with {MATLAB} software. Findings – This study contributes to the literature by exploring how the characteristics of reviews and the reviewers might shape consumer review frequency and continuity. Specifically, the authors' results show that review ratings, comments on a review, and helpful votes have a positive association with review frequency and continuity. Furthermore, the length of the textual review has a positive relationship with review frequency, but a negative relationship with review continuity. Relative to anonymous reviewers, people who write reviews and use their real names post reviews less often, but their review continuity is longer. Originality/value – This paper is the first to identify empirically variables that explain review frequency and continuity, thus enabling companies to gain a better understanding of their reviewer base and hence to manage online word-of-mouth more efficiently. It is the first study to apply a well-known behavioral model to address online review behavior.},

	shorttitle = {Trash talk rebuffed},
	abstract = {Purpose – Marketing literature views word-of-mouth ({WOM}) as unidirectional communication in which consumers transmit either positive or negative messages based on their consumption experiences. Becoming visible in online forums, however, are consumers who engage in {WOM} as part of interactions with other consumers. This article aims to investigate a phenomenon frequently occurring in these interactions: consumers who defend companies and brands against others' negative {WOM}. Design/methodology/approach – The authors investigated the online defense phenomenon in its natural setting using an online ethnography, known as a netnography. Findings – This study provides empirical evidence for the existence of six different defense styles, as well as details of the identified factors underlying consumers' choices of defense styles. Moreover, the authors' analysis highlights the different outcomes of various company- and brand-defending behaviors and illustrates that this consumer phenomenon can be effective in preventing the spread of negative {WOM} or in mitigating its impact. Research limitations/implications – Future research could benefit from further testing the effectiveness of the various defense styles as well as investigating how to stimulate this important buffer against negative {WOM}. Practical implications – Companies are increasingly allocating resources to the monitoring of online conversations so as to be able to respond to criticisms in social media. The authors' findings indicate that other consumers frequently respond to these complaints before the companies do. These company and brand defenders could replace some of the resources companies currently devote to social media. Originality/value – The present study identifies company and brand defending as a new {WOM} activity, thus extending the concept of {WOM} beyond praising and complaining. In addition, this study suggests that consumers who counter negative messages are not necessarily loyal, as previously assumed, but rather motivated by a sense of justice or a need for self-enhancement.},

This study aims to examine an integrated model of the mediating effect of satisfaction on the relationship between objective life circumstances and subjective well-being. Design/methodology/approach – The new model proposed is tested by using data obtained from British Household Panel Survey. A fixed-effects econometric model is estimated using Stata 10 to identify the mediating effect of satisfaction with life circumstances on the relationship between life circumstances and well-being. Findings – The results show that objective circumstances affect well-being primarily through the mediating effect of satisfaction with corresponding life domains irrespective of the level of objective circumstances. However, this mediating effect varies by life domain and cannot be generalized. Practical implications – The implications for public policy makers are that intervention policies that improve the three life domains of health, leisure and housing will effectively enhance consumers' well-being. Meanwhile, government should also allocate more resources to increase consumers' positive thinking to help them to improve their well-being. Originality/value – This is the first study to examine the mediating effect of subjective satisfaction on the effect of objective circumstances on well-being across six life domains.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to adopt a conservation of resources ({COR}) theoretical approach to examine the process of value co-destruction ({VCD}) emanating from the misuse of customer resources by organisations. Design/methodology/approach – A critical incidents approach was adopted where 120 customers recounted their negative experiences. The analysis identified both the nature of resources and processes involved. Findings – From a customer perspective, the {VCD} process is triggered by a failure of the resource integration process to co-create expected value (resources). This involves customers in unexpected primary, and often secondary, resource loss. Loss "cycles" or "spirals" develop impacting negatively on well-being. Customers' attempts to restore their resources through coping strategies typically involve loss of well-being for the organisation. Research limitations/implications – The research is limited to a relatively small sample of {UK} customers involving diverse contexts. However, {COR} theory provides a framework for a better understanding of customer perceived value, the value co-creation and co-destruction process. Practical implications – The findings offer a new perspective to practitioners for understanding customer expectations and behaviour. There is a need to re-evaluate and re-design value propositions in line with organisational capabilities and customers' resource needs. Social implications – Organisations' misuse of customers' resources negatively impacts on "well-being": a phenomenon of increasing interest at the societal level. Originality/value – This study is the first to empirically examine the concept of {VCD}, as perceived and experienced by customers, from a resource ecology perspective. It contributes to the growing body of work deriving from the service-dominant logic approach to value co-creation.},

	shorttitle = {A new era of consumer marketing?},
	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to address the emerging post-millennium trends in co-creational marketing, in the context of how these trends apply to the recorded and live sectors of the music industry. Consideration of marketing as a broadened concept to include societal processes has implications not only for the marketing concept itself, but also for the roles of the parties implicitly involved in the marketing process. Therefore, the standard and polarising marketing clichés of "firm and customer", "buyer and seller", and "producer and consumer" may be replaced with a more contemporary marketing approach in which value can be created and shared by either party. Design/methodology/approach – Initially the paper provides a review of contemporary literature on co-creational aspects of marketing and a subsequent identification of typologies of co-creation practices. Conceptual frameworks pertaining to the relationships of these typologies are then proposed. An extensive review and analysis of journal articles, industry reports and news sources on music industry marketing was conducted. From this review and analysis, 30 examples of co-creational marketing were identified. The music industry was chosen as it constitutes a relevant and contemporary marketing context due to the existence of interactive technology and changing consumer preferences regarding their interaction with music intermediaries and against a context of digital piracy. Findings – Five typologies of co-creational marketing were found to be relevant to the music industry. Key examples of co-creational marketing within the music industry are discussed and analysed in relation to the identified typologies and conceptual frameworks. Research limitations/implications – The relevancy of co-creational marketing practices to the music industry is investigated, followed by consideration of managerial implications and future research directions. Originality/value – The theoretical prospect of value co-creation through active consumer contributions to the marketing process is not revolutionary or new, but the implications of such a potential shift in power or influence have developed into a contemporary challenge for marketers.},

	abstract = {Purpose – A growing body of literature reveals that the domain of customer co-production of goods is expansive. Many research articles in the area of co-production of goods, however, have focused on specific sub-areas within the larger domain. One result of these multiple lines of inquiry is that they establish overlapping construct names and definitions. The purpose of this article is to propose a classification schema of customer co-production of goods based on general systems theory ({GST}). Design/methodology/approach – A logical partitioning approach was employed. Findings – A classification schema of co-production of goods is derived from two criteria: the nature of the customer's input and the customer's autonomy. The classification suggests six sub-areas of co-production of goods: restricted co-manufacturing, unrestricted co-manufacturing, co-ideation, co-design, mass customization, and participation loop. Practical implications – The distinction of activities involving co-production of goods guides practitioners in the generalization of research findings and the selection of participation opportunities for their customers. Originality/value – This study proposes the first classification schema of co-production activities resulting in tangible goods. The classification reduces the overlap of constructs and definitions, defines the domain of co-production of goods, aids in the construction of nomological networks, and delimits generalizations drawn from empirical research. The authors recommend that researchers interested in co-production of goods should use the schema to guide their theory development and empirical research designs.},

Design/methodology/approach – Digital technologies were used to automatically measure and communicate the electricity consumption of 316 {UK} residents for a period of 16 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: one involving no feedback; one involving feedback about a household's own usage, and one involving a household's own usage plus social norms feedback (the average consumption of others in the locality). At the end of the study, a selection of participants took part in interviews or focus groups. Findings – Both types of feedback (individual and individual-plus-social-norms) led to reductions in consumption of about 3 per cent. Those receiving social norms feedback were significantly more likely to engage with the information provided. However, the social norms information had no additional impact on consumption. Survey and interview data confirmed that participants from both conditions had been encouraged to adopt new energy-saving practices. The study concludes that near real-time individual feedback can be sufficient for usage reduction if it is provided in a historical format. It also suggests that the impact of social norms information may previously have been confounded with that of individual feedback. Originality/value – This is the first time that a controlled experiment in the field of domestic electricity consumption has compared the impact of real-time social norm information with that of information that only contains individual household usage.},

This paper aims to study how other consumers in the same failure and recovery influence an individual consumer to evaluate the firm's recovery efforts.

Experiment 1 tested the interaction effects between recovery modes (public vs private) and recovery dimensions (economic vs social) on an individual consumer's evaluation of a recovery strategy for a group service failure. Experiment 2 investigated the complementary role of social recovery on economic compensation. Findings – Experiment 1 identified a significant interaction effect. Results suggest that an individual in a group service failure responds more favorably to public economic recovery than to private recovery. However, an individual's reaction to social recovery follows the opposite pattern. Furthermore, in experiment 2 a complementary effect between economic recovery and social recovery was found. Originality/value – One potential contribution is that the paper sheds light on the issue related to the influence from other affected consumers in the same service failure and recovery situation in affected consumers' recovery evaluation.

The aim is to develop and test a conceptual model to establish how pay-for-performance (economic factor) affects knowledge sharing behaviour under the contingency roles of coworker relationship quality (social psychological factor) and knowledge sharing norms (sociological factor). Design/methodology/approach – Using the Dun \& Bradstreet database, the authors collected responses from 374 salespeople in 51 Canadian industrial firms through an on-line survey. The authors used hierarchical linear modeling ({HLM}) as multiple salespeople were nested within the organization and the data were comprised of individual- and organizational-level constructs. Findings – When there is misalignment between rewards and knowledge sharing behavior, motivational loss hampers knowledge sharing. However, when employees are provided with an environment that fosters high coworker relationship quality and consensual knowledge sharing norms, the motivational loss resulting from the incongruence between pay-for-performance and knowledge sharing behavior is mitigated. Research limitations/implications – Implications regarding how salespeople's knowledge sharing contributes to relationship marketing along with practical ramifications for how sales managers can encourage knowledge sharing are discussed. Originality/value – This study contributes to the sales literature (e.g. control, key account management, expanding role of sales) by testing a model that integrates different theoretical perspectives to examine what types of control mechanisms and which combinations of these controls affect salespeople's engagement in knowledge sharing behaviors.},

Design/methodology/approach – This research is based on digital camera sales data collected from amazon.com and two studies are included in this research. The first study is based on a static model and sample data from one time stamp. The second study is based on two sample data collected from two different time stamps, and a dynamic model is proposed. Findings – The results from the first study reveal that the average online customer review, the number of online reviews, the price and the camera's physical properties such as the number of pixels and the optimal zoom number (but not {LCD} screen size) have significant influence on digital camera sales. The results from the second study show that the sales from the previous period are an important indicator for future sales. In addition, change in price, change in average online review rating and change in the total number of online reviews are all significantly associated with future sales. Research limitations/implications – The research reveals that there is a significant relationship between the online user review and sales of search goods, and the influence of online user reviews on search goods sales is different from that on experience goods. It also recognizes that the product specifications influence the sales of search goods. In addition, the research on search goods shows that price at the specific time and price changes are significant factors affecting sales. Practical implications – The research indicates that retailers should provide channels for, and encourage, customer online reviews for search goods to improve sales. It is also beneficial for online retailers to provide detailed product attributes to help their customers make the purchase decision. Carefully designed and executed price promotions could also be effective ways to improve sales of searchable goods.

	abstract = {This study suggests that consumer responses to service failures may be influenced by perceptions of procedural and interactional fairness. Procedural fairness is operationalized as the consumer's opportunity to present information and express feelings, or “voice.” Interactional fairness is operationalized as an apology to the consumer. A 2 X 2 X 2 X 4 between-subjects experimental design manipulated levels of complaint outcome, apology, voice, and type of service. Apology and voice appeared to enhance fairness and satisfaction perceptions in the “favorable outcome” condition, when consumers were offered a discount or gift after service failure. When no tangible offering was made, apology and voice had lesser effect and in some instances were associated with lower perceptions of fairness and satisfaction. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed.},

We hypothesized that monitoring would negatively affect citizenship because close control may keep employees from performing duties seen as extra and perhaps not leading to rewards. However, we also hypothesized that monitoring's focus on gathering unbiased information would positively influence employees' perceptions of fairness, which have been found to predict citizenship behavior. Results of structural equations modeling used to test direct and indirect relationships among the variables indicated that the monitoring method of observation negatively influenced citizenship but also had a positive influence through its effect on perceptions of fairness.},

Since the early 1990s, researchers on inter-organizational relationships have consistently argued that mutual trust is an essential factor of relationship quality and performance. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the advancements and setbacks in current empirical research in terms of measuring inter-organizational trust. This paper analyzes the theoretical approach, the conceptualization and operationalization, and the measurement issues covered in studies on inter-organizational trust conducted from 1990 to 2003. Although trust has emerged as an important factor in inter-organizational relationships, there are still major conceptual and methodological challenges to be met in studying this complex concept. The results show major inconsistencies in conceptualization, operationalization, and measurement of trust. The paper concludes with suggestions for further empirical research.},

Recent research suggests that affective responses are important, but has mainly focused on products' performance in consumer markets. The authors extend past research by examining affective and cognitive responses to suppliers' performance in an industrial context. In a study of 150 established buyer-seller relationships in the industrial telecommunication market, they found that customers' affective responses to supplier reliability were different from their responses to supplier benevolence. Low supplier reliability was found to create negative affect, while high supplier benevolence created positive affect. Supplier reliability showed a strong positive effect on satisfaction with the supplier, which . subsequently increased loyalty. Supplier benevolence appeared to have no direct effect on overall satisfaction, but was found to influence customer loyalty indirectly through positive affect. Thus, both cognitive and affective processes mediate the effects of supplier reliability and supplier benevolence on loyalty.},

	abstract = {The authors develop a framework for understanding the behaviors and practices of service providers that build or deplete consumer trust and the mechanisms that convert consumer trust into value and loyalty in relational exchanges. The proposed framework (1) uses a multidimensional conceptualization for the trustworthiness construct; (2) incorporates two distinct facets of consumer trust, namely, frontline employees and management policies and practices; and (3) specifies value as a key mediator of the trust-loyalty relationship. The authors test the proposed model using data from two service contexts--retail clothing (N = 264) and nonbusiness airline travel (N = 113). The results support a tripartite view of trustworthiness evaluations along operational competence, operational benevolence, and problem-solving orientation dimensions. Moreover, the authors find evidence of contingent asymmetric relationships between trustworthiness dimensions and consumer trust. For frontline employees, benevolent behaviors demonstrate a dominant 'negativity' effect (i.e., a unit negative performance has a stronger effect than a unit positive performance), whereas problem-solving orientation has a dominant 'positivity' effect (i.e., a unit positive performance has a stronger effect than a unit negative performance). Value completely mediates the effect of frontline employee trust on loyalty in the retailing context and partially mediates the effect of management policies and practices trust on loyalty in the airlines context. The role of frontline employees is more critical in the retailing context, whereas management practices and policies play the dominant role in the airlines context. Overall, the proposed framework successfully models trust and loyalty mechanisms across the two industries examined in the study, while remaining sensitive to essential contextual differences.},

This article builds on existing theory to propose and empirically test a three-dimensional trust construct including ability, integrity, and benevolence dimensions. Furthermore, the article examines this conceptualization of the construct across different relationship types as established by dependence form. Methodology: We choose to use a scenario/survey data collection method to replicate specific relationship types for a national purchasing agent sample. This method allows us to obtain adequate sample sizes to compare the relative importance of trust dimensions using structural equation modeling. Findings: We found empirical evidence to support a three-dimensional trust construct for use in further examination of buyer-seller relationships. In addition, we found differential importance of those dimensions across different relationship forms. Research Implications: By providing empirical support for a multidimensional trust construct and further specifying the importance of each dimension in various relationship forms, we hope to provide a strong foundation on which to build further trust research. Practical Implications: In examining trust among purchasing agents, we hope to provide a strong foundation for salespeople to understand how their actions impact their long-term relationships. Understanding that trust in a relationship involves more than simple integrity or completing promises should help boundary spanners develop stronger ties. Contribution: The main contribution of the article is the concept that trust needs to be researched in ways other than simply asking “Do you trust your supplier?”},

A survey on young consumers is conducted focusing on corporate brands providing electronic products in China. Results support most hypotheses. Specifically, {CAA} can enhance competence-based and benevolence-based trust while having no influence on identity-based trust. {CSRA} affects relationship strength mainly through non-competence-based trust.

In addition, our results help shed light on why this occurs. Namely, mediation analyses illustrated that having status alters how we perceive others intentions, such that the belief that others have positive intentions toward us (i.e., benevolence) accounted for the relationship between status and trust.

Design/methodology/approach - Individual level data are collected from two samples (n1 = 382, = 455) and subjected to confirmatory factor analysis of an a priori two-factor structure for equity sensitivity. Sample two is randomly split and one half subjected to structural equation modeling. Findings - Superior fit in both samples is found for a two-factor structure compared to a one-factor structure. Additionally, in sample two empathy, positive affectivity, and feminine gender role identity related differentially to the factors of entitlement and benevolence. Research limitations/implications - Samples are comprise of college students. However, the average level of full-time work experience (sample one 45.6 percent {\textgreater} 1 year, sample two mean 23.57 months) is large and the racial groups in sample two are diverse (76 percent non-white).

Multi-level analyses showed that dissonance was more likely in interactions with customers, whereas deviance, that is, the violation of display rules by acting out one's felt emotion, was more likely in co-worker interactions. Well-being in the interaction was lower (a) for interactions with emotion work requirements, (b) for dissonance, even after controlling for felt negative emotions, and (c) for deviance. Negative emotion displayed partially mediated the relationship between deviance and well-being. Regarding the relationship of more stable job related attitudes, psychosomatic complaints, and aggregated scores of social interactions, fewer effects were found than in questionnaire studies, which may be due to the fact that only interactions that lasted at least 10 minutes were assessed, as is customary in research with this instrument Among the effects found, however, many involved proportions rather than frequency of interactions, which raises the possibility of balancing and legitimizing effects of non-stressful interactions.},

Based on a qualitative analysis of opinions and attitudes of twenty managers of middle and senior managers in the mass distribution, this study aims to understand why some minority players take the risk of deviance : the choice of deviance would be motivated not by a desire for opposition but by a desire to be of service to employees and customers, the desire deemed compatible with the goal of economic efficiency.

In this research, it is assumed that the sequence of customer visits over a subscription period occurs based on the Poisson process, while usage at each purchase occasion follows an autoregressive Bernoulli model of first order. The autocorrelated observations are derived from a two-state Markov chain model. Generalized linear models are employed to describe heterogeneous behavior across customers. In order to monitor the number of visits as well as the fraction of visits eventuated in a purchase, control statistics are defined on the basis of generalized likelihood ratio ({GLR}) test. Furthermore, in the case of the marginal logistic model for dependent observations, a chi-square test statistic based on the asymptotic multivariate normal distribution of quasi-likelihood estimates is employed. Performances of the monitoring schemes are compared with an illustrative case provided by simulation. Results indicate that the adjusted Shewhart c chart resembles the deviance residual control chart for monitoring the frequency of customer visit. On the other hand, the {GLR} statistic based on the conditional logistic regression is more powerful in detecting unnatural usage behavior when compared with the chi-square control statistic based on the marginal logistic model.},

It is shown that a suitable model for customer usage pattern based on the logistic regression can effectively be employed to represent both the cross correlation and serially correlation of purchase rate for different kinds of services. Then the deviance statistic is proposed as an appropriate control statistic to simultaneously monitor the usage of multiple services. On the basis of three comparative scenarios, simulation results indicate that the power of the deviance-based control chart is considerably greater than some traditional counterparts like Hotteling’s T 2 control chart. Research findings provide promising results for marketing managers and practitioners in terms of both better understanding of the behavior of different classes of customers as well as timely evaluation of investment opportunities that can lead to enhancement of the firm’s relationship with customers.},

In doing so, the study contributes contemporary empirical evidence of factors associated with the deliberate sabotage of service by frontline customer-contact personnel. Using a survey-based approach, the authors collected data form 259 respondents from a sample of 1,000 respondents. The findings largely support the hypothesized antecedents of service sabotage and show that a range of individual characteristics, management control efforts, and perceived labor market conditions are linked with service sabotage. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that service sabotage behaviors are associated with individual and group rewards, effects for customers, and other performance measures.},

This effect is moderated by the degree to which people are oriented toward extrinsic values. In addition, when materialistic thoughts are diverted, entering a lottery has no effect on self-control. In summary, this research highlights that materialism, although stable and enduring, can manifest itself in a burst of materialistic thoughts.

Design/methodology/approach – This is a conceptual approach which promotes the idea that acculturation matters for service firms operating in multicultural markets and adopts relevant propositions related to service firms' strategy in such markets. Findings – Integrating fragmented insights from consumer behaviour and multicultural marketing, the study suggests that the various interactions and contacts between ethnic groups in a multicultural country can generate acculturation outcomes that lend themselves to novel avenues for empirical research. These avenues move beyond a research focus on the presence of ethnic groups as stand-alone entities of intra-ethnic uniformity. Practical implications – Firms with a broader market horizon in a multicultural market can employ acculturation in their marketing strategy since an exclusive focus on ethnicity as a basis of segmenting the market reveals shortcomings. Otherwise, a myopic approach that ignores cross-ethnic interactions may lead to bypassing opportunities for more considerate market responses by a service firm.

Adopting social identification and relationship marketing perspectives, we examined the positive and negative aspects of online community cultivation and tested the meditating mechanisms involved in member participation processes. A survey-based study, conducted with 913 online consumers, revealed that community interaction can lead to consumer power through community identification and relationship investments. Furthermore, we found that perceived e-tailer support negatively affected the relationship between identification and consumer power. We concluded with a discussion of the key managerial and research implications of our findings.},

This study proposes and empirically examines a model of {eWOM} intention among online brand community members. Based on a survey of about 170 members of {MINI} Cooper online brand communities, the findings of this study suggest that brand identification positively influences {eWOM} intention by way of brand loyalty and community identification. In addition, trust in peer community members was found as a significant mediator of the influence of community identification on {eWOM} intention. Taken together, both brand- and community-related dimensions are crucial in predicting {eWOM} intention among brand community members. Managerially, the findings point to the prime role of online brand community members in spreading the positive word for the brand and provide insight to effective strategies for promoting favorable {eWOM} for brands, especially among the so-called brand evangelists.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study is to understand consumers' product use, practices, identity, and brand meanings in the context of a brand community dedicated to a mainstream Japanese motorcycle brand. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative research approach was used in the form of netnography (i.e. ethnography adapted to the study of online communities). Findings – On the product level, consumers experience multiple conflicts and negotiations of meaning related to the use of the product. These findings are reproduced on the brand level, where members of the brand community present a more differentiated look on the brand, accompanied by lower levels of admiration and identification with the brand, as in previous reports of brand communities for brands such as Apple, Jeep, or Harley-Davidson. The results suggest that consumers for mainstream brands may be more prone to multi-brand loyalty instead of single-brand loyalty. Practical implications – Marketers should monitor motivations, attitudes, and decision-making processes on both the product and the brand level. Further, non-company-run online communities such as the Yamaha R1 forum bear the risk of community members transmitting brand information in a way not desired by the company. Thus, marketers should consider sponsoring an entire discussion website, a forum, or part of a forum. Originality/value – Whereas previous studies on brand communities have concentrated predominantly on highly admired and differentiated brands, such as Apple or Harley-Davidson, this study investigates consumer practices, identities, and negotiations of meaning on both the product and brand level for a less differentiated mainstream brand.},

Data collected from 256 respondents were analysed by structural equation modelling, testing seven hypothesised causal links. Findings – Brand loyalty is primarily influenced by identification with the brand community, through the mediating role of brand affect. Research limitations/implications – The findings require confirmation in other settings and industry sectors before they can be generalised with confidence, but point to several fruitful research directions. Practical implications – Brand strategists have new evidence to guide allocation of effort and resources to the effective cultivation and maintenance of brand loyalty. Originality/value – The study makes an original contribution, in a real-world setting, to the understanding of how members of a brand community relate to the brand, and of how their brand loyalty is activated.},

It argues for consideration of a broader suite of values including social, cultural, historic, geographic, symbolic, environmental, and economic, to fully reflect what the destination has to offer.

	abstract = {Brand community members have a strong interest in the product and in the brand. They usually have extensive product knowledge and engage in product-related discussions; they support each other in solving problems and generating new product ideas. Therefore, brand communities can be a valuable source of innovation. So far, little is known about the member's ability and willingness to participate in a company's innovation process. How does passion for the brand, affiliation to the brand community, and trust in the brand affect the willingness to engage in a company's innovation process? What is the effect of brand passion on brand knowledge and on domain-specific skills, which are considered important prerequisites for qualified and creative contributions to new product development? What is the effect of personality traits on the willingness and ability to engage in new product development? This research addresses these questions, which are interesting for managers who are thinking about opening up their innovation process and collaborating with brand communities and for academics exploring the opportunities of online communities for new product development and trying to develop promising new forms of open innovation networks. Drawing on brand community literature, relationship theory, creativity theory, and personality traits research, this paper introduces a comprehensive set of antecedents affecting brand community members' willingness to engage in new product development. It is argued that consumer creativity, identification with the brand community, and brand-specific emotions and attitudes (passion and trust) as well as brand knowledge are important determinants of consumers' willingness to share their knowledge with producers. The paper also identifies two personality traits (i.e., extraversion and openness) that have significant influence on brand passion, creativity, and identification with the community. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 550 members of the Volkswagen Golf {GTI} car community. Structural equation modeling was used to test the relationship among the constructs. Though a positive disposition toward a brand may be advantageous for consumers that are willing to interact with producers during new product development, our results show that it is consumer interest in innovations and the innovative process that drives them to get involved. Further, brand community members with more knowledge and more innovative skills seem to be more willing to contribute than less qualified community members.},

Most of the work on {HRM} and performance as been undertaken in the {US} and recently in the {UK}. Ashok Som (2008) finds the positive effect of innovative {HRM} practices on corporate performance before and after economic liberalization in India. There are similar studies in other parts of the globe like China and Pacific Rim. Becker and Huselid (2006) have raised important question: what is the 'black box' linking business strategy and business performance. The answer according to Dave Ulrich is organizational capabilities. The focus of this paper is {HR} strategy as manifest by organizational capabilities. The corporate performance measurement has taken many forms in previous studies. D.Ulrich describes stakeholder satisfaction as a measure of performance. The present study draws on only one component of stakeholder satisfaction viz., investor satisfaction. Thus the focus of this study is the effect of organizational capabilities on investor satisfaction. It is based on a survey of 44 companies in Mumbai and Bangalore. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

The relationship between customer satisfaction and company performance has been extensively researched at both the consumer and firm levels. However, little is known about the impact of customer satisfaction at the economy-wide level, especially in Europe. This study aims to link customer satisfaction to personal consumption expenditure using panel data collected from 1999 to 2011 and covering nine European countries. Our findings suggest a significant relationship between customer satisfaction and consumer expenditure in these countries. In addition, economic structure, culture, political economy and socio-economic factors have been examined to understand the impact of cross-country differences on this relationship. The results reflect the importance of satisfied consumers on the economy as a whole; thus, efforts at boosting customer satisfaction should become a national agenda.},

	abstract = {The consumer adoption of digital media has warranted much attention over the last decade. However, relatively little has been written about how digital media has impacted upon brand management perspectives and practices. The digital era has resulted in changes in how consumers interact with brands and each other, and this shift in behaviour requires a reappraisal of how brands should be managed. The current relational paradigm is no longer sufficient. Therefore this conceptual paper calls for brand management to develop and embody a deeper understanding of this shift by adopting a revised paradigm. Current brand management issues not addressed by the relational paradigm are outlined, the new community paradigm follows, and examples of community paradigm practice are provided as a guide for brand management.},

The data across three laboratory experiments demonstrate that high-variance product reviews are more likely than low-variance product reviews to undermine product evaluation when consumers have unfavorable prior expectation about a product. When consumers have favorable prior expectation, however, high-variance product reviews can enhance or undermine product evaluation depending on product category, the argument quality of reviews, and the number of reviewers. The findings are explained by the type of causal attribution consumers make, such that high-variance product reviews can allow consumers to make biased product evaluation consistent with their prior expectation when the causes of variance in the product reviews are attributed to the reviewers rather than to the product. However, when the causes of variance are attributed to the product rather than the reviewers, high-variance product reviews can undermine product evaluation regardless of the favorability of prior expectation.},

Three experiments and one replication show that, whereas consumers who do not hold this belief respond to decision-generated threat with distrust, trust is significantly higher for those who believe in a just world (optimistic trust effect). Process evidence shows such coping is automatically activated in response to threat but can be corrected for more normative considerations when an obvious ulterior motive is present. Finally, evidence this coping serves an ego-protective function is provided by manipulating whether consumers are directly threatened. Overall, findings are consistent with the view that belief in a just world operates as a positive illusion that allows consumers to cope with decision threat.},

Design/methodology/approach – Data for this study were collected from among managers of a major player in the community banking sector within the European Union. A total of 274 valid responses were obtained from 398 managers. Findings – The results indicate that individuals with different combinations of {BIS}-{BAS} levels demonstrate varying degrees of willingness in adopting and contributing towards the {CRM} system. Practical implications – These results can be useful for human resources managers, who can screen individuals for positions requiring customer interface and effective use of {CRM} systems. The need to align employees' characteristics with {CRM} goals and strategies is critical to the successful application of {CRM} systems but has often not been given sufficient attention. Originality/value – This paper demonstrates that individual behaviour can be attributed to different personality traits, which in turn can be traced back to physiological as well as psychological origins.

Based on a sample of analysts following companies measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index ({ACSI}), we find that customer satisfaction reduces earnings forecast errors. However, analysts respond to changes in customer satisfaction but not to the {ACSI} metric per se. Furthermore, the effects of customer satisfaction are asymmetric; for example, analysts are more willing to use good news (i.e. an increase in customer satisfaction information) than bad news (i.e. a decrease in satisfaction). Similarly, customer satisfaction reduces negative deviation more than positive deviation of the analysts' forecasts from actual earnings. Furthermore, the effects of customer satisfaction depend upon the base level of satisfaction that the firm has achieved. Finally, the effects of customer satisfaction on analysts' forecast errors differ across firms with volatile satisfaction scores and those with stable satisfaction scores. We discuss the implications of our results for marketers and participants in financial markets. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Stepwise regression analysis is used to examine the effect of the mediating variable (i.e. perceived value) on customer satisfaction. Perceived value was found strongly correlated with satisfaction. Results suggested that perceived value is an important factor in customers' evaluation of satisfaction.

	abstract = {Purpose – Previous research has emphasized the pivotal role that salespeople play in customer satisfaction. In this regard, the relationship between salespeople's attitudes, skills, and characteristics, and customer satisfaction remains an area of interest. The paper aims to make three contributions: first, it seeks to examine the impact of salespeople's satisfaction, adaptive selling, and dominance on customer satisfaction. Second, this research aims to use dyadic data, which is a better test of the relationships between constructs since it avoids common method variance. Finally, in contrast to previous research, it aims to test all of the customers of salespeople rather than customers selected by salespeople. Design/methodology/approach – The study employs multilevel analysis to examine the relationship between salespeople's satisfaction with the firm on customer satisfaction, using a dyadic, matched business-to-business sample of a large European financial service provider that comprises 188 customers and 18 employees. Findings – The paper finds that customers' evaluation of service quality, product quality, and value influence customer satisfaction. The analysis at the selling firm's employee level shows that adaptive selling and employee satisfaction positively impact customer satisfaction, while dominance is negatively related to customer satisfaction. Practical implications – Research shows that customer-focus is a key driver in the success of service companies. Customer satisfaction is regarded as a prerequisite for establishing long-term, profitable relations between company and customer, and customer contact employees are key to nurturing this relationship. The role of salespeople's attitudes, skills, and characteristics in the customer satisfaction process are highlighted in this paper. Originality/value – The use of dyadic, multilevel studies to assess the nature of the relationship between employees and customers is, to date, surprisingly limited. The paper examines the link between employee attitudes, skills, and characteristics, and customer satisfaction in a business-to-business setting in the financial service sector, differentiating between customer- and employee-level drivers of business customer satisfaction.

	abstract = {This research is the first to examine service sweethearting, an illicit behavior that costs firms billions of dollars annually in lost revenues. Sweethearting occurs when frontline workers give unauthorized free or discounted goods and services to customer conspirators. The authors gather dyadic data from 171 service employees and 610 of their customers. The results from the employee data reveal that a variety of job, social, and remuneration factors motivate sweethearting behavior and several measurable employee traits suppress its frequency. The results from the customer data indicate that although sweethearting inflates a firm's satisfaction, loyalty, and positive word-of-mouth scores by as much as 9\%\%, satisfaction with the confederate employee fully mediates these effects. Thus, any benefits for customer satisfaction or loyalty initiatives are tied to a frontline worker that the firm would rather not employ. Marketing managers can use this study to recognize job applicants or company settings that are particularly prone to sweethearting and as the basis for mitigating a positive bias in key customer metrics.

	abstract = {Purpose – This study aims to discuss and test the combined role of perceived risk, objective knowledge and certainty as moderators in the satisfaction-loyalty relationship. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use survey data of 387 Vietnamese consumers in a food context. A structural equation modeling ({SEM}) approach for moderator analysis with latent constructs is used to test the hypotheses. Findings – Perceived risk is a barrier in the forming of loyalty with a negative moderating effect on the satisfaction-loyalty relationship. However, the satisfaction-loyalty relationship is stronger when objective knowledge and certainty increase. Research limitations/implications – The object and setting are limited to one product category in one market. In addition, other moderators (e.g. situation and ambivalence) can be added. The nature of causality is problematic due to the use of survey design. Practical implications – Customer management based on satisfaction is not sufficient to keep customers' loyalty, especially in the situations of highly perceived risk and uncertainty. Marketing strategies, which reduce consumers' risks, consolidate their confidence and educate them with relevant knowledge, may be effective strategies to increase their loyalty. Originality/value – The study fills several gaps in the present literature. First, it overcomes some shortcomings of previous studies of moderators in the satisfaction-loyalty relationship by testing the combined role of three important moderators. Second, it tests the moderator effect of objective knowledge and adds an extra explanation to previous studies. While some previous studies suggest a negative moderator effect of subjective knowledge, this paper argues for and confirms a positive moderator effect of objective knowledge on this relationship. Finally, it uses {SEM} for moderator analysis with latent constructs. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Marketing managers can increase shareholder value by structuring a customer portfolio to reduce the vulnerability and volatility of cash flows. This article demonstrates how financial portfolio theory provides an organizing framework for (1) diagnosing the variability in a customer portfolio, (2) assessing the complementarity/similarity of market segments, (3) exploring market segment weights in an optimized portfolio, and (4) isolating the reward on variability that individual customers or segments provide. Using a seven-year series of customer data from a large business-to-business firm, the authors demonstrate how market segments can be characterized in terms of risk and return. Next, they identify the firm's efficient portfolio and test it against (1) its current portfolio and (2) a hypothetical profit maximization portfolio. Then, using forward- and back-testing, the authors show that the efficient portfolio has consistently lower variability than the existing customer mix and the profit maximization portfolio. The authors provide guidelines for incorporating a risk overlay into established customer management frameworks. The approach is especially well suited for business-to-business firms that serve market segments drawn from diverse sectors of the economy. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Applying structural equation modeling to data collected from a sample of airline passengers reveals that perceived safety is one of the key drivers that can explain the degree of overall customer satisfaction. This relationship is, however, strongly moderated by the purposes for which airline passengers travel (i.e., either for business or pleasure). Perceived safety has a significantly greater impact on the overall customer satisfaction of people who travel for pleasure than on that of business travelers, which implies that airlines should more strongly emphasize safety features in advertising aimed at leisure travelers.

However, there are paradoxes in marketing practitioners' efforts to build personalised deals and relationships. In this paper, I propose 5 propositions about the 'darker sides' of {CRM}, introducing these paradoxes and pitfalls that should be considered in the implementation of {CRM} and in efforts to build buyer-seller relationships. These propositions include (1) the one-to-one dilemma; (2) selecting and favouring customers; (3) the relationship symmetry; (4) monitoring, tracking and using customer behavioural data; and (5) neglecting the relationship trust. The implications for managers are evident. Findings starkly reveal the importance of understanding the role of fairness, transparency, goodwill and trust in customer relationship management than previously considered.

	abstract = {Many multinational corporations have implemented cross-national satisfaction measurement programs for tracking and benchmarking the satisfaction of their customers across their various markets. These companies measure satisfaction with the goal of maximizing customer loyalty and the financial benefits associated with loyalty. However, existing research comparing consumer satisfaction across nations is limited, with the few existing studies examining only a small number of countries or predictors of satisfaction, or a small group of consumers within a particular economic sector. To expand our knowledge of the determinants of cross-national variation in customer satisfaction, we study three sets of factors: cultural, socioeconomic and political-economic. We utilize a unique sample of cross-industry satisfaction data from 19 nations, including nearly 257,000 interviews of consumers. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that consumers in traditional societies have higher levels of satisfaction than those in secular-rational societies. Likewise, consumers in self-expressive societies have higher levels of customer satisfaction than those in societies with survival values. We also find that literacy rate, trade freedom, and business freedom have a positive effect on customer satisfaction while per capita gross domestic product has a negative effect on customer satisfaction. We discuss the implications of these findings for policymakers, multinational corporations, and researchers. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

This paper examines factors that influence consumers'' decisions to keep or spend their accumulated points. We found that consumers are more likely to spend points when they can easily anticipate the benefits they can enjoy with the points. Specifically, the decision to spend points is facilitated when it is easier to compute the percentage savings one can get by using the points. This computational ease has effects on point spending beyond that of saving magnitude. [Copyright \&y\& Elsevier]},

The study confirms the impact of negative news stories on relationship building. The experiment that was run to collect data provides a better understanding of how differently slanted news stories, when combined with customer satisfaction levels, affect customer-corporate relationships.

Using k-means clustering analysis, we find clusters within this demographic based on levels of being connected on and being engaged with social networking services. Research results show that the majority of this demographic have accounts on multiple social networking sites, with more than 40\% having profiles on three social networking sites and an additional 20\% having four social networking accounts. We also investigate the motivations for using different social media sites, showing that the reasons for engaging differ among sites.

	abstract = {A truism in the marketing literature, and among many marketing practitioners, is that requiring consumers to wait negatively impacts quality evaluations, purchase intentions and a range of other important outcomes. However, it is also true that consumer waiting or queuing has historically been considered from an operations perspective. The present research takes a different approach and examines waits in the context of their ability to function as a signal of quality. Four experiments demonstrate a required wait can indeed signal quality to consumers and increase, rather than decrease, both purchase intentions and actual experienced satisfaction. Three moderators of this effect are examined: preexisting knowledge, consumption motivations, and the extent to which quality is difficult to objectively determine. The results suggest in situations where quality is important, unknown or ambiguous, managers may increase consumer satisfaction by making consumers wait. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {In this paper, we measure the impact of interactive technology on student satisfaction and find support for the hypothesis that students who find a class is more interesting because of the use of interactive technology will be more satisfied with the course. The results also support the hypothesis that if students like the course, they will be satisfied with it. However, we do not find significant links between student satisfaction and either (1) their belief that they retain more due to the use of interactive technology or (2) their enjoyment of the use of interactive technology in the course. Thus, while the use of interactive technology can increase course satisfaction by making the course more interesting, the fact that students like the technology itself does not affect course satisfaction.

	abstract = {The Net Promoter Score ({NPS}) and the American Customer Satisfaction Index ({ACSI}) are metrics used to predict sales, profit and share price change. We identify problems with the design of both the {NPS} and the {ACSI}. In particular, we find that the {NPS} does not measure negative word of mouth effectively, and we argue that the {ACSI} is similarly insensitive to dissatisfaction. This is because ex-customers and never-customers are not sampled in these metrics, and these are the people who express most of the negative sentiments about brands/companies. We propose a method of measuring the effect of word of mouth using the volume and mean impact on purchase probability of both the positive and the negative word of mouth expressed by users of the category.

This study contributes to the literature by investigating the effect of motives for online shopping on e-satisfaction and e-loyalty. A structural equations model is developed and tested through data from an online survey involving 797 customers of two {UK}-based e-tailers focussing on hedonic products. The results suggest that convenience, variety seeking, and social interaction help predict e-satisfaction, and that social interaction is the only shopping motive examined with a direct relationship to e-loyalty. Data also show that e-satisfaction is a strong determinant of e-loyalty. These findings are discussed in the light of previous research and avenues of future research are proposed.

We provide an adaptive strategy for dealing with poor performance. Experiment 1 shows that poor performers tend to recruit the highest potential performance as a comparison standard and hence are dissatisfied. However, if they are reminded that they set their own low goals, and that these goals were met, they are as satisfied as better performers. Experiment 2 shows that incremental theorists who believe that they can improve their performance in the future tend to compare their performance to the initially set goal rather than the highest potential performance, and are hence as satisfied as better performers. These findings shed light on the dynamic comparison process underlying satisfaction judgment. Implications of these findings for perennial low goal setters and for satisfaction in general are discussed. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Online communities provide a social sphere for people to share information and knowledge. While information sharing is becoming a ubiquitous online phenomenon, how to ensure information quality or induce quality content remains a challenge because of the anonymity of commentators. This paper introduces moderation into reputation systems. We show that moderation directly affects strategic commentators' incentive to generate useful information, and moderation is generally desirable to improve information quality. We find that when being moderated with different probabilities based on their reputations, commentators might display a pattern of reputation oscillation, in which they generate useful content to build up high reputation and then exploit their reputation. As a result, the expected performance from high-reputation commentators can be inferior to that from low-reputation commentators (reverse reputation). We then investigate the optimal moderation resource allocation and conclude that the seemingly abnormal reverse reputation could arise as an optimal result. Our study underscores the importance of moderation and highlights that the frequency of moderation should be properly chosen for better performance of online communities. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Brand contacts are a variety of elements about how customers come into contact with a brand and how they communicate their values about it to other potential customers. For the sake of cost and efficiency, brand contacts can be investigated not only from a customer perspective but also from that of the service provider. This paper thus attempts to integrate the Kano model and quality function deployment ({QFD}) to explore brand contact elements. The results gained from an empirical study of a hot spring hotel indicate that customers' perceptions about contact elements are mostly classified into one-dimensional and must-be attributes by the Kano model. The proposed approach contributes to the creation of attractive contact elements that have an enormous potential to further increase customer satisfaction and differentiate competitors. Moreover, along with the 10 technical characteristics obtained by the integrated approach, the customers' contact experiences are displayed through the brand contact priority grid, both of which provide references for future hotel business development. Lastly, atmosphere-oriented brand contacts dominate customers' brand perceptions more than others, in that they lessen customers' sense of risk and uncertainty toward product/service offerings. A discussion of the findings including managerial implications is also presented in this paper. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {The 'saddle' is a sudden, sustained, and deep drop in sales of a new product, after a period of rapid growth following takeoff, followed by a gradual recovery to the former peak. The authors test for the generalizability of the saddle across products and countries and for three rival explanations: chasms in adopter segments, business cycles, and technological cycles. They model both boundary points of the saddle-start of the sales drop and recovery to the initial peak-using split-population models. Empirical analysis of historical sales data from ten products across 19 countries shows that the saddle is fairly pervasive. The onset of the saddle occurs in 148 product-country combinations. On average, the saddle occurs nine years after takeoff, at a mean penetration of 30\%, and it lasts for eight years with a 29\% drop in sales at its depth. The results support explanations of chasms and technological cycles for information/entertainment products and business cycles and technological cycles for kitchen/laundry products. The authors conclude with a discussion of the findings, contributions, and implications. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Loyalty programs offer rewards via mediums of different magnitudes (e.g., "\$6 off when you accumulate 1,000 [100] points. Earn 10 [1] points/dollar"). The program medium presents two key pieces of information: reward distance (points required to redeem reward) and step size (points earned per dollar), in higher-magnitude (vs. lower-magnitude) programs, both reward distances (1,000 vs. 100) and step sizes (10 vs. 1 point[s]/dollar) are larger. How do these two pieces of information affect consumers' postenrollment inferences of progress, store loyalty, and recommendation likelihood? Do consumers always integrate both pieces? We identify a moderator, step-size ambiguity, and show that when ambiguity Is high, only reward distance affects inferences. When ambiguity is lower, consumers integrate step size with reward distance, but in a biased manner. Implications arise in goal following and in physical and psychological distance estimation contexts (e.g., weight loss, savings) where distances and step sizes can vary (e.g., as a function of units: kilograms vs. pounds), but especially in loyalty rewards contexts.

As a result, marketers and advertising companies are always looking for more effective and newer communication media and evaluation methods of advertising effectiveness. The present study attempts to examine the effects of Avishan company's {TV} advertisement (As a big clothing producer company in Iran) on customers' attention to advertisement, interest for purchasing, desire for purchasing, action of purchasing and eventually customers' satisfaction in Babol city. The results show that the {TV} advertisement was effective in taking attention of customers, creating interest, desire and action of purchasing.

A structural equation model using a correlation matrix with maximum likelihood was estimated by {LISREL} 8.8. The results indicate that from the attractiveness factors, retail tenant mix and atmosphere were the most influential factors in shopping centers and retail tenant mix was strongly affected by product range and to some extent by merchandise value.

	abstract = {Customer satisfaction is universally acknowledged as a key driver of customer repurchase behavior, but recent evidence suggests that satisfaction has no effect on repurchase under certain circumstances. In this study, the authors develop a framework for understanding the complex relationships among satisfaction, moderating variables, and repurchase. They propose that the satisfaction-repurchase link is subject to complementary and substitute effects and present satiation and inertia as key theoretical mechanisms that explain and predict those effects. In weak-satiation purchase categories, complementary effects are more likely, which suggests that managers should invest in customer satisfaction and complementary initiatives simultaneously. In strong-satiation purchase categories, substitute effects are more likely, which suggests that managers should invest in either customer satisfaction or substitute initiatives. An empirical test combining survey and longitudinal purchase data from two categories-fashion apparel and automobile service-provides a remarkable degree of support for the propositions. The findings offer new theoretical insights and substantive guidance for managers to effectively allocate resources to initiatives that complement or substitute for customer satisfaction.

For more knowledgeable consumers, unexpected subcategory formats provide a newness cue, thereby increasing effort, learning, and satisfaction. That is, unexpected subcategory formats help more knowledgeable consumers overcome complacency and benefit more from their shopping experience. Conversely, unexpected subcategory formats lead to decreases in learning and satisfaction among lower prior knowledge consumers. Interestingly, we also find that consumers are relatively well calibrated with regard to the effects of more and less expected subcategory formats, anticipating that less expected formats may help more knowledgeable consumers. Taken together, these findings suggest that subcategory formats can be tailored to consumers' prior knowledge levels in ways that yield both expected and actual benefits. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Six studies show that subtle contextual cues that increase customers' self-awareness can be used to influence their satisfaction with service providers (while holding the objective service delivery constant). Self-awareness cues tend to increase customers' satisfaction when the outcome of a service interaction is unfavorable, but they tend to decrease customers' satisfaction when the outcome of the interaction is favorable. This is because higher self-awareness increases customers' tendency to attribute outcomes to themselves rather than to the provider. Self-awareness can even influence satisfaction with service interactions that occurred far in the past. The authors demonstrate these effects across a variety of lab and field settings with different simulated retail experiences and with different real-life service interactions, including college courses, meals taken at a university cafeteria, and items purchased at an actual clothing store. The results further show that attempts to shape customers' satisfaction by means of self-awareness are more likely to be effective when there is substantial customer responsibility for the outcome; when customers' responsibility is limited, such attempts may backfire.

The five dimensions have different impacts on satisfaction with the program, loyalty to the program, and perceived relationship investment of the firm.

	abstract = {Although managers are interested in the financial value of customers and researchers have pointed out the importance of stock analysts who advise investors, no studies to date have explored the implications of customer satisfaction for analyst stock recommendations. Using a large-scale longitudinal data set, the authors find that positive changes in customer satisfaction not only improve analyst recommendations but also lower dispersion in those recommendations for the firm. These effects are stronger when product market competition is high and financial market uncertainty is large. In addition, analyst recommendations at least partially mediate the effects of changes in satisfaction on firm abnormal return, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Analyst recommendations represent a mechanism through which customer satisfaction affects firm value. Thus, if analysts pay attention to Main Street customer satisfaction, Wall Street investors should have good reason to listen and follow. Overall, this research reveals the impact of satisfaction on analyst-based outcomes and firm value metrics and calls attention to the construct of customer satisfaction as a key intangible asset for the investor community.

Furthermore, many examples from different countries are introduced to compare with Chinese consumers. Results from the study show low customer awareness about point-based reward programs and low redemption rates. Further study shows the strong correlation between lack of awareness about the reward-point program and the low level of interest among customers toward the program. Key factors that affect the redemption of reward points include the awareness of the reward-point program, the attractiveness of the incentives, duration of the credit card, and frequency of credit card usage. This article suggests that effective communication by credit card marketers and customers' experience with the benefits are essential to promote awareness of the point-based reward programs.

Options that vary along comparable dimensions are alignable, whereas options that vary along unique dimensions are nonalignable. The results of three studies demonstrate greater search among nonalignable than among alignable options. Satisfaction initially increases but then declines with further search among nonalignable options. Although choice difficulty influences search and satisfaction, the primary mechanism driving the inverted U-shaped relationship of satisfaction with search among nonalignable options is feature learning. This research demonstrates a paradox: People continue searching more options precisely when their further search is detrimental to their satisfaction, falling down the slippery slope of search.

Previous attempts to predict consumer spending growth using standard macroeconomic predictor variables have met with little success. The authors show that the lagged change in customer satisfaction, which contributes to future demand, has a significant impact on spending growth. However, this impact is moderated by increases in consumers' debt service ratio, a key budget constraint that affects consumers' ability to spend. Using an asymmetric growth model, more than 23\% of the variation in the one-quarter-ahead spending growth is explained, which represents a notable improvement over prior specifications.

	abstract = {Recent research challenges the idea that greater choice is always desirable, showing that larger assortments can increase choice deferral and switching. The current research demonstrates that even when consumers make a purchase, the same item may generate lower satisfaction when chosen from a larger rather than a smaller assortment. The authors explain this effect in terms of an expectation-disconfirmation mechanism. When assortments are small, consumers have low expectations about their ability to match their preferences. As assortment sizes increase, so do consumers' expectations of the degree of preference match they can achieve. Subsequently, consumers may experience greater negative expectation disconfirmation or less positive expectation disconfirmation when a chosen item comes from a larger rather than a smaller set. Either less positive or more negative disconfirmation leads to lower choice satisfaction. The results from three studies support this expectation-based process and establish this mechanism in addition to alternative explanations, such as choice overload. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

The study sets out to examine corporate informational, affective, and functional initiatives managers take to influence three trustworthiness factors—competence, benevolence, and integrity—and to elicit forgiveness. A scenario-based experiment conducted to test the conceptual model found support for most hypotheses. According to the results, rebuilding a trustworthy image and earning consumer forgiveness are crucial steps in repairing consumer trust. A clear pattern of influential factors for different trustworthiness aspects was found, indicating that affective initiatives are the most effective strategy in shaping a corporate image of integrity and benevolence, and that providing sufficient information is a key activity for enhancing consumers' judgment about the firm's competence. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, several studies have argued that customer satisfaction has high relevance for financial markets because it has a significant impact on stock returns. However, little attention has been given to understanding the impact of customer satisfaction on the risk of stock returns. The finance literature suggests that investors that judge performance only in terms of returns place more resources than warranted in risky opportunities, forgo profitable opportunities, and apply misguided performance evaluations. Accordingly, this study develops, tests, and finds empirical support for the hypotheses that positive changes (i.e., improvement) in customer satisfaction result in negative changes (i.e., reduction) in overall and downside systematic and idiosyncratic risk. Using a panel data sample of publicly traded U.S. firms and satisfaction data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, the study demonstrates that investments in customer satisfaction insulate a firm's stock returns from market movements (overall and downside systematic risk) and lower the volatility of its stock returns (overall and downside idiosyncratic risk). The results are robust to alternative measures of risk, model specifications, and concerns related to sample composition criteria raised in some recent studies. Therefore, the results indicate that customer satisfaction is a metric that provides valuable information to financial markets. The robust impact of customer satisfaction on stock returns risk indicates that it would be useful for firms to disclose their customer satisfaction scores in their annual report to shareholders.

Our findings reveal that in cases where the patient feels close to the physician, psychological comfort with the physician is the most important factor in predicting patient retention. For those who feel less close to the physician, satisfaction is theprimary predictor of patient retention. Therefore, as a close relationship develops between the patient and doctor, the patient's comfort level becomes increasingly important as an exit barrier, even outweighing patient satisfaction.

	abstract = {Purpose - Despite the proliferation of retail loyalty programs, little is known about differences in the behavior patterns of the consumers within them. There may be several unique segments within a loyalty program, and significant managerial implications may accrue from identification of these segments and analysis of differences among them. This paper aims to investigate the potential for deriving meaningful, managerially relevant customer segments within a retail loyalty-type program. Design/methodology/approach - Data from the one-year test of a retail loyalty card program by a major {US} retailer were used to derive patronage-based segments and explore determinants of segment differences and strategy implications. A numerical taxonomy process was used to group 57,650 loyalty-card program members into distinct segments. Cluster analysis was used to generate a range of potential market structures on a set of managerially relevant variables. The most appropriate market structure was selected using scree testing and discriminant analysis. Each of the resulting six segments was named profiled. Finally, a set of patronage-related variables was regressed on to the clusters using multinomial logistic regression. Findings - The results indicate that, at least for this card program, clearly defined segments with unique patronage profiles do exist both descriptively and statistically; only a small percentage of loyalty card program members demonstrate behaviors that can be considered truly loyal; and different marketing strategies appear appropriate to try and increase patronage among the segments based on their profile characteristics. Originality/value - This study should prove valuable to academic researchers as well as managers. It is the first effort to generate meaningful, rigorously derived segments within a large loyalty program. It shows that behavioral variables can yield managerially relevant segments, and that the segments appear to call for individualized strategy initiatives. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

Our analysis of data from 300 consumers shows that (1) the offline channel is generally preferred over the online channel across all the stages, and (2) the channel usage intention in a particular stage is moderated by the consumer's Internet experience. Specifically, in both the pre- and post-purchase stages, the usage intention for the online channel is higher when consumers have more favorable Internet experience. In the purchase stage, consumers prefer the offline channel over the online channel, regardless of their Internet experience. Furthermore, we find that the drivers of channel preference are substantially different across the three buying stages due to (in)congruities between channel benefits desired and channel capabilities offered.

In this article, the role of category risk, product complexity, and customer category knowledge in moderating the impact of recommendation agents on consumer welfare is examined. A controlled experiment simulating a recommendation agent was used in conducting this study. Various product characteristics for which the recommendation agent provided information were manipulated. The results support some of the hypothesized effects. It is shown that category risk moderates the impact of recommendation agents on decision quality and product complexity moderates the role of recommendation agents on amount of search.

	abstract = {Recommendation agents ({RAs}) are software agents that elicit the interests or preferences of individual consumers for products, either explicitly or implicitly, and make recommendations accordingly. {RAs} have the potential to support and improve the quality of the decisions consumers make when searching for and selecting products online. They can reduce the information overload facing consumers, as well as the complexity of online searches. Prior research on {RAs} has focused mostly on developing and evaluating different underlying algorithms that generate recommendations. This paper instead identifies other important aspects of {RAs}, namely {RA} use, {RA} characteristics, provider credibility, and factors related to product, user, and user--{RA} interaction, which influence users' decision-making processes and outcomes, as well as their evaluation of {RAs}. It goes beyond generalized models, such as {TAM}, and identifies the {RA}-specific features, such as {RA} input, process, and output design characteristics, that affect users' evaluations, including their assessments of the usefulness and ease-of-use of {RA} applications. Based on a review of existing literature on e-commerce {RAs}, this paper develops a conceptual model with 28 propositions derived from five theoretical perspectives. The propositions help answer the two research questions: (1) How do {RA} use, {RA} characteristics, and other factors influence consumer decision making processes and outcomes? (2) How do {RA} use, {RA} characteristics, and other factors influence users' evaluations of {RAs}? By identifying the critical gaps between what we know and what we need to know, this paper identifies potential areas of future research for scholars. It also provides advice to information systems practitioners concerning the effective design and development of {RAs}. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

Findings based on online retailing trends also suggest that both search engines and infomediaries are beginning to play a strong role in leading consumers to online retail sites. Additionally, some practitioner studies find that about half of online consumers use comparison shopping sites before choosing a retailer. Retailers therefore need to understand whether search engines or infomediaries play a stronger role in bringing unplanned consumers. This is the issue that we investigate in this research. Our results indicate that, retailer and consumer factors, category characteristics and the consumer's past relationship with the retailer do play a role in the store choice decisions of online consumers. Between search engines and infomediaries, however, search engines play a far stronger role than infomediaries. The effect is, in fact, more than twice that of infomediaries.

	abstract = {For online marketplaces to succeed and prevent a market of lemons, their feedback mechanism (reputation system) must differentiate among sellers and create price premiums for trustworthy sellers as returns to their reputation. However, the literature has solely focused on numerical (positive and negative) feedback ratings, alas ignoring the role of feedback text comments. These text comments are proposed to convey useful reputation information about a seller's prior transactions that cannot be fully captured with crude numerical ratings. Building on the economics and trust literatures, this study examines the rich content of feedback text comments and their role in building a buyer's trust in a seller's benevolence and credibility. In turn, benevolence and credibility are proposed to differentiate among sellers by influencing the price premiums that a seller receives from buyers. This paper utilizes content analysis to quantify over 10,000 publicly available feedback text comments of 420 sellers in {eBay}'s online auction marketplace, and to match them with primary data from 420 buyers that recently transacted with these 420 sellers. These dyadic data show that evidence of extraordinary past seller behavior contained in the sellers' feedback text comments creates price premiums for reputable sellers by engendering buyer's trust in the sellers' benevolence and credibility (controlling for the impact of numerical ratings). The addition of text comments and benevolence helps explain a greater variance in price premiums (R² = 50\%) compared to the existing literature (R² =20\%-30\%). By showing the economic value of feedback text comments through trust in a seller's benevolence and credibility, this study helps explain the success of online marketplaces that primarily rely on the text comments (versus crude numerical ratings) to differentiate among sellers and prevent a market of lemon sellers. By integrating the economics and trust literatures, the paper has theoretical and practical implications for better understanding the nature and role of feedback mechanisms, trust building, price premiums, and seller differentiation in online marketplaces.

Findings from a series of experiments indicate that the incentive that is offered in a loyalty program is important to whether the program succeeds or fails at building brand loyalty. The data reported suggest that incentives that have overlap with brand associations, which the authors term cue-compatible incentives, can prompt rehearsal that increases the accessibility of favorable brand associations. This, in turn, helps boost postprogram loyalty. At the same time, incentives that are tangible or concrete can undermine postprogram loyalty. This seems to occur because elaboration is attracted to the incentive at the expense of the brand. Incentive associations may thus gain in accessibility and interfere with access to brand associations. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

To this end, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of the reported findings on customer satisfaction. They document that equity and disconfirmation are most strongly related to customer satisfaction on average. They also find that measurement and method factors that characterize the research often moderate relationship strength between satisfaction and its antecedents and outcomes.

	abstract = {Despite the claim that satisfaction ratings are linked to repurchase behavior, few attempts can be found that relate satisfaction ratings to actual repurchase behavior. This article fills this void by presenting a conceptual model for relating satisfaction ratings and repurchase behavior. The model is based on the premise that ratings observed in a typical customer satisfaction survey are error-prone measures of the customer's true satisfaction, and they may vary systematically on the basis of consumer characteristics. The authors apply the model to a large-scale study of 100,040 automotive customers. Results show that consumers with different characteristics have different thresholds such that, at the same level of rated satisfaction, repurchase rates are systematically different among different customer groups. The authors also find that the nature and extent of response bias in satisfaction ratings varies by customer characteristics. In one group, the response bias is so high that rated satisfaction is completely uncorrelated to repurchase behavior (r = 0). Furthermore, the authors find that, though nonlinear, the functional form relating rated satisfaction to repurchase intent is different from the one relating it to repurchase behavior. Although the functional form exhibits decreasing returns in the case of repurchase intent, it exhibits monotonically increasing returns in the case of repurchase behavior.

	abstract = {In virtually all marketing channel relationships, one of the parties eventually will engage in an action that another channel member considers potentially destructive for the relationship. How a particular channel member reacts to such an act has implications for the long-term viability and success of the relationship. On the basis of a large data set collected from both a focal supplier and its independent dealers, the authors classify dealers' responses to a supplier's destructive acts by extending the response typology of exit, voice, and loyalty, which is based on Hirschman's seminal writings on responses to decline in organizations and states. This study finds that dealers' reactions are influenced by several antecedent factors: perceived intensity of the supplier's destructive act, the attributions relative to the act, relationship quality before the act, and the level of interdependence between dealer and supplier. The results suggest that these more proximal dealer responses affect subsequent dealer performance and overall perceptions of relationship quality after an act. The authors draw several implications for both dealers and suppliers. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

	abstract = {Previous research has suggested that more participation (high process-control) in decision-making is always preferable to less (low process-control). Some research, however, has stated that any level of participation less than full decision-control is pseudo-participation. Often, no control is seen as desirable over solely process-control. This paper tests theories of distributive justice, procedural justice and referent cognitions in a laboratory experiment. It finds one form of process-control is a viable form of participation. Subjects allowed only a voice (low process-control) in setting budgets, experienced greater budget and task satisfaction than subjects allowed no input. This effect occurs even when unattainable (unfair) budgets are received. No effect is found on performance. Further, this research finds that high process-control (vote for standard) is effective only when attainable (fair) budgets are achieved. When unattainable (unfair) budgets are received, subjects with a vote (high process-control) experience less task and budget satisfaction than individuals with only a voice (low process-control). Subjects with high process-control (vote) form referent cognitions (i.e., more definitive impressions of what their budgets will be). Subjects in the voice (low process-control) conditions do not form these referent cognitions. Thus, subjects in the vote conditions form stronger feelings of dissatisfaction when unattainable (unfair) budgets are received. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

By contrasting the behavior of Danish bureaucrats with Nazi bureaucrats in World War {II}, a more adequate understanding of democratic patriotism can be obtained. It must be founded upon a knowledge of, and belief in, democratic values. But more is required, since public servants must guarantee those rights to others under all conditions. It requires the intentional inculcation, and practice of, benevolence -which is the extensive and non-instrumental love of others. We have termed this "the patriotism of benevolence" and argue that it must be the primary motivation of public servants in the United States.},

Apparently they have been little concerned about the frequent inability of marketing data to meet the requirements for maximum likelihood estimation or the common occurrence of improper solutions in {LISREL} modeling. The authors demonstrate that partial least squares ({PLS}) can be used to overcome these two problems. {PLS} is somewhat less well-grounded than {LISREL} in traditional statistical and psychometric theory. The authors show, however, that under certain model specifications the two methods produce the same results. In more general cases, the methods provide results which diverge in certain systematic ways. These differences are analyzed and explained in terms of the underlying objectives of each method.

The study was  exploratory because, first, satisfaction and performance were considered simultaneously as dependent variables even though previous research indicated they were  unrelated [2, 8, 18]. Second, the study attempted to apply personality variables derived from Ziller's theory of  Self-Other Orientation. The primary implication of the study is that there is a significant canonical relationship between perceived performance-satisfaction and power, social interest, marginality, identification intensity, and openness for this sample. The low satisfaction-performance correlation  and the significant canonical correlation imply that the two dependent variables should be studied in concert for the most meaningful results. This study suggests that as a salesman's perceived power over customers increases, sales performance and job satisfaction increase. A high power positioning may be interpreted as a search for security in interpersonal relations without respect for objective information [22, 24]. Our findings are consonant with the observation that in order to close a transaction a salesman must dominate his customer [12] and with a study which  revealed that low aggression was related to less successful performance [13]. Marginality in this study referred to the positioning of the salesman between employer and customers; it was, in a restricted sense, a measure of interorganizational marginality, which the findings associate with high sales performance.

	abstract = {Analytical customer relationship management ({CRM}) systems make firms more informed than ever about their customers. This further gives firms the ability to serve customers selectively in a way that ensures retaining profitable customers and eliminating unprofitable ones. However, when firms of products/services with network effects decide to eliminate unprofitable customers, they may face the risk associated with firing them, which is user-based shrinkage. This risk incurred as a result of network effects has been widely neglected in {CRM} literature. In this study, considering this risk, we investigate when firms can eliminate unprofitable customers in the competitive market with network effects and consumer switching costs, which often co-exist with network effects, using a game-theoretic model of a duopoly. Our results show that it is not desirable for firms to fire unprofitable customers in the presence of strong network effects or sufficiently low consumer-switching costs. Otherwise, firms can fire unprofitable customers and benefit from the ability to eliminate them. An interesting point is that competing firms can be better off when both have the ability to eliminate unprofitable customers in the presence of moderate switching costs and small network effects.

The {CRM} scorecard was developed through a rigorous and stepwise development process collaborated with a number of firms in a variety of industries. During the development process, we conducted an extensive literature review to build a theoretical causal map, in-depth interviews with practitioners to extract a hierarchical map from industrial perspectives, feasibility tests to check whether or not Key Performance Indicators ({KPI}) could be measured, and Analytic Hierarchy Process ({AHP}) analysis to prioritize the evaluation factors on the {CRM} scorecard. The {CRM} scorecard contains antecedent/subsequent and objective/perceptual evaluation factors in four different perspectives to comprehensively measure corporate {CRM} capability and readiness. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed {CRM} scorecard, we apply the framework to a retail bank in Korea well-known for its exemplary {CRM} strategy. [Copyright \&y\& Elsevier]},

Ten marketing and sales managers, and their respective customers, from a variety of New Zealand companies were interviewed. Their perspectives on the relationship between {CRM} technology and relationships were recorded and analysed. In addition, their views of what are elements of strong relationships and relationship performance were explored. Findings indicate that {CRM} technology does have a role to play in sustaining and maintaining B2B relationships, but it is the customer communications and people aspect that may be most important. Customers have expectations of {CRM} technology and are generally more optimistic that {CRM} will provide benefits to the customer in terms of customer satisfaction and service. Respondents were in agreement that the important elements of relations include trust, commitment and communications. Relationship performance is generally measured using customer satisfaction, loyalty and/or customer retention. Future research will focus on developing a {CRM} technology adoption instrument and empirically testing the conceptual model with larger samples. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

It also investigates the {CRM} tools functionality in the strategic, process, communication, and business-to-customer (B2C) organisational context and reports the extent of their use.

Despite the evidence provided by numerous empirical studies, many companies that have implemented {CRM} systems report unsatisfactory levels of improvement. This study analyzes what influence companies can expect {CRM} implementation to have on performance and how they can leverage its impact. The authors propose a conceptual model that investigates the link between technological and organizational implementations, as well as the implementations'' interactions with management and employee support and {CRM} process-related performance. By measuring {CRM} performance in terms of the initiation, maintenance, and retention of customer relationships, the study provides a detailed picture of what {CRM} implementations are capable of achieving. The results of the empirical study, conducted across four industries and ten European countries, indicate that {CRM} implementation does not impact performance equally for different aspects of the {CRM} process, and that it has an impact only if adequately supported by the appropriate company stakeholders.

Customer relationship management system ({CRMS}) is an innovative technology which facilitates the process to acquire, develop, and maintain customer relationships more efficiently and effectively. From the business perspective, patients represent the major customers of the hospital who receive and feel the healthcare services directly and realistically. Although the critical factors for the adoption of information systems have been identified in previous studies, few have specifically explored {CRMS} adoption in hospitals despite the fact that it has dramatic impacts on the quality of healthcare services and customer satisfaction. To fill this gap, this study proposes an integrated model that incorporates both organizational and system related factors as primary determiners of {CRMS} adoption in hospitals. A series of surveys were conducted with three levels of health institutions in Taiwan: medical centers, regional hospitals, and community hospitals. The results indicated that hospital size, {IS} capabilities of staff, innovation of senior executives, knowledge management capabilities, and relative advantage have significant influence on the {CRMS} adoption. The research results also reveal constructive suggestions to researchers, hospitals, {CRMS} vendors, and the government to increase the likelihood of adopting {CRMS}. [Copyright \&y\& Elsevier]},

However, this prediction and its causal mechanism have never been studied experimentally. Five studies show that greater equality increases the satisfaction of those in the lowest tier of the distribution because it reduces the possession gap between what they have and what others have. However, greater equality also increases the position gains derived from status-enhancing consumption, since it allows low-tier consumers to get ahead of the higher proportion of consumers clustered in the middle tiers. As a result, greater equality reduces consumption when consumers focus on the narrower possession gap, but it increases consumption when they focus on the greater position gains (i.e., when consumption is conspicuous, social competition goals are primed, and the environment is competitive).},

Although the {CLV} model is appropriate for managing a single non-replaceable customer, the application of a {CLV} model to the acquisition and valuation of customers as an ongoing concern for the firm leads to sub-optimal customer relationship management and acquisition strategies. This leads the firm following a {CLV} maximization approach to have a smaller and less profitable customer base than one that follows a {CE} maximization strategy. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

In response to this, researchers and practitioners have proposed several conceptual models. Despite recent advances in research, the results are still inconclusive as to the relationship between customer attitude and future sales. A reason for this could be due to the paucity of studies combining survey-based data with behavioral data to understand better the drivers of customer behavior. With that in mind, the authors investigate the effects of customer perceptions of key marketing actions on customer attitudes and actual customer behavior as reflected by future sales. The authors propose that customer perceptions of value, brand, and relationship—“customer equity drivers”—affect loyalty intentions and future sales. The results of the study, which is based on a sample of 5694 customers of a large European do-it-yourself retailer, suggest that customer equity drivers can significantly predict future sales, even after the authors control for the current sales level.

Managers can use the approach to develop customized strategies for targeting customers, monitoring brand “health,” allocating resources, and determining the values of brands in a merger or acquisition. The empirical results suggest that the proposed metric for measuring consumer-level brand equity has convergent validity; in addition, the magnitudes and strengths of brand equity vary considerably across consumers and brands. At the firm level, the results show that previous methods are likely to overstate brand equity, especially for products with low market shares.

The investigated antecedents consists of sector, competitive and demand, and firm characteristics. To test the hypotheses, we surveyed 180 retail companies active in 15 retail sectors, 37\% of which have a loyalty program. The survey data are complemented with expert judgements on sector characteristics. We estimate multi-level models for both loyalty program adoption and perceived effectiveness (tobit-2 specification). We find that the sector characteristics assortment homogeneity and average purchase frequency stimulate loyalty program adoption considerably. Further, customer-oriented firms are most likely to adopt loyalty programs. Contrary to loyalty program adoption, the effectiveness of a loyalty program in terms of additional customer knowledge and customer loyalty is hardly affected by market and organizational factors. But it appears that retail companies should better take into account their technological skills necessary for obtaining useful information from the customer loyalty program data.

This paper discusses the potential of loyalty programs to alter the normal market patterns of repeat-purchase behaviour which characterise competitive repeat-purchase markets. In line with this thinking, a large scale loyalty program is evaluated in terms of its ability to change normal repeat-purchase patterns by generating 'excess loyalty' for brands in the program. Panel data were used to develop Dirichlet estimates of expected repeat-purchase loyalty statistics by brand. These estimates were compared with the observed market repeat-purchase behaviour. Overall a trend towards a weak level of excess loyalty was observed, although the expected deviation was not consistently observed for all the loyalty program brands. Only two of the six loyalty program participant brands showed substantial excess loyalty deviations. However, these deviations in repeat-purchase loyalty were observed for non-members of the loyalty program as well as members and appear likely to be at least partially the result of other loyalty efforts particular to these brands.

Design/methodology/approach - Equity theory and exchange theory are the theoretical foundations used for evaluation of the aspects of loyalty program fairness. Findings -- First, through the application of equity theory, firms can more effectively recognize and reward more valuable customers without alienating less valuable customers. Second, through the use of exchange theory, firms can secure authorization to collect and use individual customer information from customers in exchange for enhanced value proposition offerings via loyalty programs. Loyalty programs can induce customers to give up their personal information in exchange for benefits they would not otherwise receive. Marketers use the higher level of benefits available through loyalty programs as a form of compensation to customers for sharing personal information. Practical implications -- Customer loyalty programs that are equitably administered and thoroughly communicated will be perceived favorably by consumers. Originality/value -- This paper marks the first study to examine the issue of consumer fairness as it relates to how firms use loyalty programs to collect proprietary information and differentiate value propositions among customer segments. The findings can be used by managers to strengthen the marketing position of the firm through a loyalty program without compromising on their customers' perceptions of fairness.

	abstract = {Purpose- Although relationship marketing has developed into the prevailing marketing paradigm, it frequently encounters resistance from the demand side. Both management practitioners and academics indicate that at least some consumers show reactance against loyalty programs, i.e. against tactical instruments of relationship marketing. Nevertheless, relationship marketing has widely neglected reactance theory. This paper attempts to close this gap. Design/methodology/approach- Based on the fundamental principles of loyalty programs and reactance theory the paper presents a set of hypotheses on the determinants and effects of situational consumer reactance against loyalty programs. It tests these hypotheses on the basis of 388 face-to-face interviews with bookstore customers. These interviews include a between-subject manipulation on the reactance effect of economic, social-psychological, and contractual bonding potentials. To test the proposed hypotheses, the paper applies structural equation modeling with {PLS}. Findings- As expected, contractual bonds provoked reactance effects, while social-psychological bonds neither increased reactance, nor the perceived utility of the program. Economic bonds raised perceived utility up to a certain threshold level, from which the reactance effect dominated thereafter. Practical implications- As a consequence, a cautious and limited application of customer loyalty programs is advisable. The developed consumer reactance scale can help managers to evaluate the effects of planned or implemented customer retention measures. Originality/value- This is the first attempt to investigate situational reactance in a loyalty program setting. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

However, if loyalty rewards programs increase relationship durations and usage levels, customers will be increasingly exposed to the complete spectrum of service experiences, including experiences that may cause customers to switch to another service provider. Using cross-sectional, time-series data from a worldwide financial services company that offers a loyalty reward program, this article investigates the conditions under which a loyalty rewards program will have a positive effect on customer evaluations, behavior, and repeat purchase intentions. The results show that members in the loyalty reward program overlook or discount negative evaluations of the company vis-a-vis competition. One possible reason could be that members of the loyalty rewards program perceive that they are getting better quality and service for their price or, in other words, "good value."

Their findings suggest that perceived switching costs are highly effective in driving share of wallet at low rather than high levels of attitudinal loyalty, and only when combined with an attractive reward program. The attractiveness of a reward program, on the other hand, has a positive impact on share of wallet regardless of the level of psychological attachment to the company. These findings are particularly important for service providers in markets characterized by undifferentiated product offerings and low perceived switching costs between service providers.

The purpose of this paper is to improve theoretical and empirical knowledge about the impact of retailing loyalty programmes on customer purchasing behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - The effects of two loyalty programmes on customer behaviour are studied through marketwide panel data on supermarket purchases. Findings - The impact of loyalty programme membership on customer purchase behaviour is significant. Research limitations/implications - All behavioural indicators show that members and non-members of loyalty programmes demonstrate significantly different purchase behaviours, irrespective of other factors. The purchase intensity of cardholders, in terms of total and average shopping baskets, share of purchases, purchase frequency and inter-purchase time, is significantly higher than that of non-members throughout the entire three-year period and the trading areas. The findings require confirmation in other retailing sectors before they may be considered fully generalisable. Practical implications - Retailers may apply the findings in their attempts to segment their target market, which enables them to allocate their marketing expenditures more effectively. Originality/value - The study contributes to more `generalisable" knowledge by investigating marketwide scanner panel data about competitive purchasing, loyalty programmes and store locations.

Loyalty program members may have a much higher share-of-wallet at the firm with the loyalty program than non-members have, but this does not necessarily imply that loyalty programs are effective. Loyal customers may select themselves to become members in order to benefit from the program. Since this implies that program membership is endogenous, we estimate models for both the membership decision (using instrumental variables) and for the effect of membership on share-of-wallet, our measure of behavioral loyalty. We use panel data from a representative sample of Dutch households who report their loyalty program memberships for all seven loyalty programs in grocery retailing as well as their expenditures at each of the 20 major supermarket chains. We find a small positive yet significant effect of loyalty program membership on share-of-wallet. This effect is seven times smaller than is suggested by a naïve model that ignores the endogeneity of program membership. The predictive validity of the proposed model is much better than for the naïve model. Our results show that creating loyalty program membership is a crucial step to enhance share-of-wallet, and we provide guidelines on how to achieve this. [Copyright \&y\& Elsevier]},

Moving beyond a single case study, the authors examine previously published research in conjunction with data collected in nine brand communities comprising a variety of product categories, and they identify a common set of value-creating practices. Practices have an “anatomy” consisting of (1) general procedural understandings and rules (explicit, discursive knowledge); (2) skills, abilities, and culturally appropriate consumption projects (tacit, embedded knowledge or how-to); and (3) emotional commitments expressed through actions and representations. The authors find that there are 12 common practices across brand communities, organized by four thematic aggregates, through which consumers realize value beyond that which the firm creates or anticipates. They also find that practices have a physiology, interact with one another, function like apprenticeships, endow participants with cultural capital, produce a repertoire for insider sharing, generate consumption opportunities, evince brand community vitality, and create value. Theoretical and managerial implications are offered with specific suggestions for building and nurturing brand community and enhancing collaborative value creation between and among consumers and firms.},

Specifically, since—in large sets—perceptual costs of processing alternatives varying in shape are greater than for alternatives varying in color, the peak of the satisfaction function for the latter will lie to the right of the former.

	abstract = {Abstract: Variance-based {SEM}, also known under the term partial least squares ({PLS}) analysis, is an approach that has gained increasing interest among marketing researchers in recent years. During the last 25years, more than 30 articles have been published in leading marketing journals that have applied this approach instead of the more traditional alternative of covariance-based {SEM} ({CBSEM}). However, although an analysis of these previous publications shows that there seems to be at least an implicit agreement about the factors that should drive the choice between {PLS} analysis and {CBSEM}, no research has until now empirically compared the performance of these approaches given a set of different conditions. Our study addresses this open question by conducting a large-scale Monte-Carlo simulation. We show that justifying the choice of {PLS} due to a lack of assumptions regarding indicator distribution and measurement scale is often inappropriate, as {CBSEM} proves extremely robust with respect to violations of its underlying distributional assumptions. Additionally, {CBSEM} clearly outperforms {PLS} in terms of parameter consistency and is preferable in terms of parameter accuracy as long as the sample size exceeds a certain threshold (250 observations). Nevertheless, {PLS} analysis should be preferred when the emphasis is on prediction and theory development, as the statistical power of {PLS} is always larger than or equal to that of {CBSEM}; already, 100 observations can be sufficient to achieve acceptable levels of statistical power given a certain quality of the measurement model.

The {HSQM} views service quality as a three-tiered concept with interaction quality, outcome quality and physical environment quality as initial sub-dimensions. The study aims to apply {HSQM} to two new service contexts and to further investigate the relationship between service quality, as measured by this instrument, and satisfaction and customer loyalty. To this end, five hypotheses are to be submitted to empirical tests. Design/methodology/approach The data for empirically re-assessing the scale's properties and for testing the proposed hypotheses were collected from convenience samples of 250 customers of hairdresser/barber services and 300 customers of local phone service subscribers. The measurement model of the {HSQM} was re-assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Findings The results confirm the {HSQM} as predictor of satisfaction and loyalty. However, the results suggest that the significance of various service quality dimensions differs depending on the type of service. Practical implications From a managerial perspective, the {HSQM} is useful for assessing service quality at various levels. It allows firms to recognize problems in their delivered interaction quality, outcome quality, or the physical service environment.

Applying a methodology that deals with three interlinking issues, risk adjustment, abnormal returns estimation and portfolio aggregation, we find that the trading strategies do not provide compelling evidence that the market mis-prices the value of customer satisfaction.

There are now some industries in which numerous rival loyalty programs are offered, inducing intense competition among these programs. However, existing research on loyalty programs has often studied such programs in a noncompetitive setting and has often focused on a single program in isolation. Addressing this gap, this research examines the effect of a firm's competitive positioning and market saturation on the performance of the firm's loyalty program. Based on the analysis of firm- and individual-level data from the airline industry, the results indicate that larger firms tend to benefit more from their loyalty program offerings than smaller firms. Moreover, when the product category demand is rigid, the impact of an individual loyalty program decreases as the marketplace becomes more saturated with competing programs. However, when the product category is highly expandable, the saturation effect disappears. Under such situations, loyalty programs can help an industry gain competitive advantage over substitute offerings outside the industry, and multiple programs can effectively coexist even under a high level of market saturation.

Traditionally, most financial valuation models do not include customer-related metrics such as customer satisfaction in the process. Studies in marketing, on the other hand, have consistently found that customer satisfaction improves the ability to predict future cash flows, long-term financial measures, stock performance, and shareholder value. This research examines the impact that customer satisfaction has on firm value by employing valuation models borrowed directly from the practice of finance. The data used in the analysis is compiled by merging publicly available customer satisfaction data from the {ACSI} (American Customer Satisfaction Index) with financial data from {COMPUSTAT}, and Center for Research in Securities Prices between 1996 and 2006. The results indicate that a portfolio of stocks consisting of firms with high levels and positive changes in customer satisfaction will outperform lower satisfaction portfolios along with Standard \& Poor's 500… Customer satisfaction does matter!

They identify a reinforcing mechanism that operates when loyalty program partnerships are operating effectively. The results suggest that customer usage of (and satisfaction with) the core service influences customer cross-buying from loyalty program partners. The cross-buying behavior then reinforces the customer's relationship with the core service, as cross-buying positively influences future purchases of the core service. Furthermore, the authors find that these reinforcing effects are influenced by the type of cross-buying service (partner) being considered. This dynamic reinforcement mechanism has not been shown in prior research. These findings have implications for understanding and management of loyalty programs and brand partnerships; valuating return on investments in improvements in product quality, service quality, and customer satisfaction; and more broadly, the dynamics of customer purchase behavior.

	abstract = {This paper addresses some important issues involving the effective deployment of ever-increasing {VIP} program budgets. Recent research results on the effects of {VIP} programs have been somewhat mixed. Some studies have found a positive influence on consumer behavior, while others report no significant impact. The purpose of this research is to provide a possible explanation for such contradictory evidence in the literature. The results of this study reveal that customer responses to {VIP} programs depend on their loyalty traits. Specifically, two loyalty dimensions—behavioral loyalty and attitudinal loyalty—interact with each other in moderating the impact of {VIP} programs on customer response. A {VIP} program may produce positive results even for customers who are low in behavioral loyalty, with low spending levels, if their attitudinal loyalty is high. Conversely, such a program may not produce significant results even for high-spending customers if their attitudinal loyalty is not high enough. Thus, analysis that overlooks the moderating role of loyalty dimensions may have led to erroneous conclusions. Finally, at the managerial level, this paper points out the potential problems of relying solely on behavioral loyalty measures, such as purchase amount, in identifying {VIP} customers. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Several studies show a decrease in employees' trust toward their organization; in parallel, organizations want to develop a long-term employment relationship to remain competitive in a context of employee shortage (Robinson and Rousseau, 1994). How can organizations develop a high level of organizational trust among their employees? In this article, we propose to integrate organizational trust℄defined as "the willingness of the employee to be vulnerable to the actions of the organization" (Mayer, Davis and Schoorman, 1995)⁄into a chain of relationships between {HRM} practices, perceived organizational support ({POS}) and two attitudes that reflect a long-term link with the organization: affective commitment and intention to quit. Our hypotheses suggest that organizational trust will partially mediate the link between {POS} and employees' attitudes (i.e., affective commitment and intention to quit). As many past studies found a direct link between {POS}, affective commitment and intention to quit (Eisenberger et al., 1986, 1997, 2001; Rhoades, Eisenberger and Armeli, 2001; Shore and Tetrick, 1991; Shore and Wayne, 1993; Wayne, Shore and Liden, 1997), we expect that the mediation will be partial. A direct and negative link is also expected between affective commitment and intention to quit. Finally, the chain of relationships identifies two examples of {HRM} practices—skills development practices and communication practices—as potential antecedents of organizational trust (Lamsa and Pucetaite, 2006) and {POS} (Allen, Shore and Griffeth, 2003). {HRM} practices generate a perception of support favourable to trust, because those practices illustrate the attention the organization gives to employees. The chain of relationships is tested with a three-wave longitudinal design that is more appropriate for the study of causal relations between variables than a cross-sectional design. We used {AMOS} 4.01 software to test two alternative models: the first model does not include organizational trust in path analyses; the second model includes this variable in the structural equation model. Results show that the second model has better fit indexes than the first model (Chi 2 = 170.79; {RMSEA} = 0.05; {CFI} = 0.97; {GFI} = 0.93). We validate that organizational trust partially mediates the relationship between {POS} and affective commitment, and fully mediates the relationship between {POS} and intention to quit. The last part of the article aims to discuss results. We focus the discussion on three major contributions: (1) the integration into one unique model of several research fields that were tested only separately in the past; (2) the mediating role of trust in this chain of relationships; (3) the use of a longitudinal design that provides guaranties about the direction of tested relationships. Despite these strengths, our research has several limitations; specifically, we did not control risks of common variance for the answers given in the same questionnaire. (English)},

Despite the prevalence of these programs, there is only a limited amount of research that focuses on the stage before program implementation. The main purpose of this study is to formulate a theory of designing ex ante competitive loyalty programs, and subsequently to provide supporting empirical evidence. The author argues that loyalty programs could be classified into two types: monetary-based rewards and special treatment-based rewards. The author proposes a theory that posits that customer perceptions of the utility of loyalty programs differ between the two types of reward, and are contingent upon the relationship between the customer and the firm. Programs that are perceived favorably by customers will in turn create stronger attitudinal loyalty and higher customer profitability. Using settings of airline passengers and bank customers, the results of the research produce findings that monetary rewards are perceived to provide higher utility perceptions of customers in contractual relationships as compared to non-contractual relationships. However, this research failed to provide empirical support that special treatment rewards are perceived to provide higher utility perceptions of customers in non-contractual relationships compared to contractual ones. The research also models consumer switching using the Markov Chain, and reveals that higher program utility perception is associated with higher attitudinal loyalty, thereby increasing customer equity. Firms are encouraged to incorporate affective elements into their loyalty programs, additional to monetary elements. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

	abstract = {Loyalty is a crucial part of today’s business because retaining a customer is generally less expensive than attracting a new one. This relationship also holds true in e-commerce. Most of the e-loyalty programs available on the Internet utilize cash-back rewards. A new type of e-loyalty program in which customers are offered a fraction of merchant firm’s equity is emerging recently. The profitability of this approach versus cash-back reward programs is still an open question. In this paper, we first survey current e-loyalty programs, and then develop a two-period duopoly model in which one of the firms gives customers a small fraction of its equity and the other offers cash-back reward for a purchase. We derive analytical conditions to compare the total profits generated through each loyalty program. In particular, we find that equity-based e-loyalty programs provide higher total profits than those of cash-back programs in markets where it is difficult for customers to switch between firms.

Limited research shows how moderators influence the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in a service context; this article aims to present empirical evidence of the conditions in which the satisfaction-loyalty relationship becomes stronger or weaker. Design/methodology/approach — Using a sample of more than 700 customers of {DIY} retailers and multi-group structural equation modelling, the authors examine moderating effects of several firm-related variables, variables that result from firm/employee-customer interactions and individual-level variables (i.e. loyalty cards, critical incidents, customer age, gender, income, expertise). Findings — The empirical results suggest that not all of the moderators considered influence the satisfaction-loyalty link. Specifically, critical incidents and income are important moderators of the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Practical implications — Several of the moderator variables considered in this study are manageable variables. Originality/value — This study should prove valuable to academic researchers as well as service and retailing managers. It systematically analyses the moderating effect of firm-related and individual-level variables on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty. It shows the differential effect of different types of moderator variables on the satisfaction-loyalty link. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

The authors develop a comprehensive dynamic model of customer loyalty to account for the impact of negative {CIs} on both the nature and the magnitude of the relationships between satisfaction and customer share. The results indicate that {CIs} trigger a stronger updating of the customer relationship, which moves customers from a business-as-usual mind-set to a reconsideration of the relationship. Furthermore, nonlinearities in the relationships are much more pronounced in the presence of {CIs}. Depending on the relationship quality, {CIs} have different consequences for customer relationships, and if relationship quality is high, a negative {CI} can even have a positive impact on customer share.

	abstract = {Purpose - Studies on customer satisfaction and loyalty have focused on brand rather than product. It is not that brand is not important, but the process of loving a brand starts with a product. Customers appreciate products by themselves, independent of the brand, as shown in their pursuit of satisfaction and development of loyalty. Such appreciation seems to be prominent regarding innovative products when compared to traditional products. This paper aims to investigate this issue and provide a product-brand typology. Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes the form of empirical research on a partial application of the typology. Findings - Results show that the relationship satisfaction-loyalty is significantly present when evaluating products alone albeit a weaker presence than when evaluating brand alone. Such unequal presence is corroborated in both traditional (bottled wine) and innovative (electronic) products even though it is much stronger in innovative products. The relationship satisfaction-loyalty is also present when evaluating product and brand combined, indicating that there is an intermediate position between product and brand. In contrast, the literature treats brand and product-brand as being in the same category thereby diminishing the importance of a useful difference between brand and product-brand. Practical implications - There are practical consequences of applying the typology and examining the findings. The relationship satisfaction-loyalty starts with the product, includes the product-brand, and culminates with the brand. This process is significantly more important regarding innovative products, such as electronics, as compared to traditional products such as wine. Originality/value - This study introduces a typology underscoring the pursuit of satisfaction and development of loyalty in three conditions of product presence versus brand presence, that is, product alone, brand alone, and product and brand combined.

	shorttitle = {Customer Loyalty Programs},
	abstract = {Loyalty programs are very common in practice. Many researchers have worked at understanding the impact of loyalty programs on market competition and the mechanism behind it. Interestingly, almost all of the studies have explored a symmetric equilibrium where both of the competing firms offer a loyalty program. To our knowledge, the extant literature has not investigated in-depth whether asymmetric equilibrium can exist where only one firm chooses to offer a loyalty program and the other firm chooses to compete via lowering prices. Such a question is important because some markets do support such asymmetric equilibriums with respect to loyalty programs. Also, the existence of asymmetric equilibrium shows that a loyalty program need not be profitable for some firms. In this paper, we use a game-theoretic framework to investigate specific types of customer loyalty programs that provide benefit to loyal customers in the form of discount over market prices. The model considers consumer switching and includes two types of consumer heterogeneity. The first type of heterogeneity concerns the differences between customers with respect to their liking for loyalty programs, and the second type concerns the differences among the loyalty program members with respect to their ability to collect enough loyalty points to redeem loyalty rewards. By analyzing a duopoly market, we find that both symmetric equilibrium (i.e., where both competing firms offer the loyalty program) and asymmetric equilibrium (i.e., where one firm alone offers the loyalty program) can be sustained. The paper explores conditions for the existence of these two equilibriums. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

The current research examines the long-term impact of a loyalty program on consumers' usage levels and their exclusive loyalty to the firm. Using longitudinal data from a convenience store franchise, the study shows that consumers who were heavy buyers at the beginning of a loyalty program were most likely to claim their qualified rewards, but the program did not prompt them to change their purchase behavior. In contrast, consumers whose initial patronage levels were low or moderate gradually purchased more and became more loyal to the firm. For light buyers, the loyalty program broadened their relationship with the firm into other business areas. The findings suggest a need to consider consumer idiosyncrasies when studying loyalty programs and illustrate consumers' cocreation of value in the marketing process. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

Few empirical studies have segmented the customer base of an organization into low and high relational groups to assess how evaluations vary for these groups. Using structural equation analysis, the authors analyze the relationships of satisfaction, trust, and commitment to component satisfaction attitudes and future intentions for the customers of a New York off-Broadway repertory theater company. For the low relational customers (individual ticket buyers and occasional subscribers), overall satisfaction is the primary mediating construct between the component attitudes and future intentions. For the high relational customers (consistent subscribers), trust and commitment, rather than satisfaction, are the mediators between component attitudes and future intentions.

An exploratory pilot study was undertaken to gain a better understanding of these users and to test the research instrument. Structural equation modeling was used to test the constructs. Findings — The results showing the best-fit model identified a number of relationships that were unexpected. These are discussed in detail. Practical implications — Managers have a model, survey instrument and methodology that service firms can use to establish what they are doing right or wrong to retain customers. Managers are also given guidelines on how to increase customer satisfaction in B2B services. Originality/value — This paper deals with these constructs in a B2B service environment.

Because rural tourism is a relatively new phenomenon in some countries, the main antecedent of tourism loyalty remains infrequently studied in rural lodgings. In this work, a structural equations model is explored, with {PLS} technique, giving relevance to the interrelationships among image, quality, satisfaction, and trust and among these variables and the tourists' behavior variables. Instruments are identified and exploratory research was undertaken among rural tourists of the main rural lodgings in two border regions of Spain and Portugal. The results confirm image as a direct antecedent of perceived quality, satisfaction, trust, and loyalty for rural tourism, too. The analysis also confirmed that quality has a positive influence on satisfaction and loyalty, and trust has a positive influence on loyalty. Image is shown as a key factor to rural lodging managers.

In our model, brand trust is specified as a second-order factor that is determined by first-order factors of competence and benevolence.

Consumer empowerment is a positive subjective state evoked by consumer perceptions of increasing control. As a positive state, increasing consumer empowerment should be associated with increasing consumer satisfaction. If such a relationship exists, it may be influenced by a number of contextual variables. Knowing in what contexts empowerment has a greater impact on satisfaction would help marketers decide when they could more effectively use such a strategy. This study has two purposes: 1) to investigate the relationship between consumer empowerment and satisfaction and 2) to investigate a set of potential influences on that relationship. Marketers will be in a better position to decide when to empower consumers if they have guidance on the relationships between these variables. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

Design/methodology/approach - Two sets of data were collected, one in the {USA} and the other in Korea, using a mall intercept method. Males and females over 18 who had online purchase experience were chosen as respondents. Findings - The results with 385 usable questionnaires (182 from the {USA} and 203 from Korea) revealed that firm reputation contributes to customer loyalty by increasing customer satisfaction, and this effect is stronger in Korea than in the {USA}. However, contrary to the expectations, no cultural differences were found in reputation-trust and trust-loyalty links. That is, firm reputation leads to customer loyalty through trust in both cultures and the impacts are the same across cultures. Research limitations/implications - Further validation of the findings with other cultural settings merits attention. Practical implications - The firm reputation-satisfaction-loyalty link is stronger in Korea than in the {USA}. While it may be premature to conclude the link is stronger in all Asian markets, international managers should carefully consider this finding when establishing operations in Asian markets.

Although much research has looked at the relationship of both of these factors individually, little is known about them when they are considered together. Furthermore, experience with the service or product has largely been neglected in this line of research. This paper aims to undertake a first step to fill this gap. Design/methodology/approach — This research, with data from one of Europe's most modern night-train companies, employs structural equation modelling to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings — Differentiating new customers from experienced ones, the results show that for new customers satisfaction is crucial whereas image plays a much smaller role in terms of loyalty. For experienced customers, however, the importance of satisfaction decreases whereas the impact of image increases. Research limitations/implications — Satisfaction and image were both measured by a single item. Although they show high face validity, the findings should be replicated using a multiple-item approach. Future research should also consider distinguishing between transaction-specific satisfaction and cumulative satisfaction. Practical implications — This paper concludes that customers' experience plays a decisive role in predicting loyalty. Managers should therefore be aware of the level of their customers' experience and may even consider developing different retention programmes tailored to the level of customers' experience. Originality/value — This research proposes an integrative model of satisfaction, image, and loyalty, and analyses the impact of experience within this model. It is pioneering work that empirically investigates the relationships between these constructs. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

Furthermore, our results show that chat group characteristics influence customer satisfaction directly as well as indirectly via perceived technology attributes. Online chat satisfaction in turn influences behavioral intentions. Finally, group-level perceptions are found to add considerably to perceptions at the individual level. Our study illustrates that structuration theory provides a sound foundation for theoretical development and empirical investigation of online group chat. Also it shows that retailers need to carefully manage the intricate interplay between technology, chat groups, and online advisors to foster a satisfying experience for customers.

	abstract = {Purpose — This paper aims to explore how relational constructs (total interdependence, trust, commitment, cooperative norms and conflict) impact the buyer's relationship satisfaction across the relationship lifecycle. Design/methodology/approach — Data were collected through mail survey from a sample of 162 Australian buyers. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to purify the measurement scales and multiple regression analysis techniques using dummy variables were used to test the hypotheses. Findings — The results indicate that interdependence and trust are associated with higher relationship satisfaction in the build-up and maturity phases while commitment is associated with higher relationship satisfaction in the maturity phase. Unexpectedly, cooperative norms are found to drive relationship satisfaction in both the build-up and maturity phases. Conflict, however, is not found to affect relationship satisfaction in the decline/deterioration phase. Research limitations/implications — A limitation of this study is the unequal sample size in each of the relationship phases. It would be desirable to run a model consisting of the five relational constructs for each of the three phases. Originality/value — Literature has suggested that the effects of relational constructs on outcomes vary across relationship phases. While this notion has been established theoretically, there has been little attempt to measure it empirically. This paper provides an empirical test of the important, yet unexplored, question of how different relational constructs have different effects on buyer satisfaction depending upon the relationship phase.

At the same time, there has been a call for the discipline to focus on accurate measurement of the outcome of marketing activities (Rust, Ambler, Carpenter, Kumar, \& Srivastava, 2004). Extant research in this area has predominantly examined the sales and profitability of relationships through customer life time analysis or examined attitudinal measures such as satisfaction and loyalty. This paper attempts to combine both streams of research by examining the profitability, satisfaction and probability of switching associated with transactional customers, relationship customers (less than five years of relationship) and deep relationship customers (more than five years of relationship) in three business to business industries. The results demonstrate the transactional customers are most profitable followed by relationship and deep relationship customers. The probability of switching was in the reverse direction of profitability and there were no difference in satisfaction measures.

The starting point is the premise that the current classifications of prizes found in the academic literature focus on the offer, are reductionist, and only permit the establishment of eventual effects between such rewards and one part of the programmes (the monosponsor type). Therefore, from the programme users’ viewpoint, we propose to contrast the importance of the rewards in comparison to other management elements. Subsequently, from a classification of incentives based on consumers’ preferences, we will determine their interest in such rewards and establish the influence of these rewards on consumers’ satisfaction with the programmes. The results will allow us to establish effective conclusions for the management of multisponsor programmes and will represent a basis of useful specific knowledge for future investigations focused on understanding this important marketing instrument.Journal of Database Marketing \& Customer Strategy Management (2007) 15, 37–48. doi:10.1057/palgrave.dbm.3250066; published online 3 December 2007 [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

	shorttitle = {Project Management in Economic Intelligence},
	abstract = {Economic Intelligence ({EI}) is a concept that is the subject of multiple definitions. Undoubtedly, these are due to the confusion on the word 'intelligence' (i.e. the 'intelligence and espionage' in English, but 'knowledge and expertise (or know-how)' in Latin meaning like in French), [1]: 'Sometimes equated with economic espionage, sometimes traditional methods of strategy information processing for the benefit of the few companies, (...)'. However, most experts in France and Europe seem to agree on the definition of B. Carayon (2003). For this author, doing Economic Intelligence, is trying to master, i.e. seek and protect, the critical information necessary to perform an economic activity in a business firm [1]. The key verbs of the Economic Intelligence are: inform, anticipate and defend interests. One of the challenges of {EI}, as completed in 'The Economic Intelligence: guide for beginners and practitioners - Programme of the European Commission', is 'to transform the mass of data available in different forms, from many sources, which is often unorganised, and collected through several channels, into information, and then into knowledge and then into intelligence' [2]. The coordination actions are commonly admitted by {EI} practitioners as: 'search', 'processing' and 'distribution' for 'exploitation'. Starting from both experience and theoretical researches in {EI}, Information systems ({IS}) and knowledge management ({KM}) domains [2],[3] are joint with the use of Natural Language Processing ({NLP}). In methodology approach, {NooJ} is used to add semantic methods to the {EI} system allowing a gain of performance in information retrieval, in decision-problem elicitation towards information monitoring. The first part of our paper consists to provide briefly the definitional framework of what is {EI} and to present the interest using {NooJ} Plateform to implement semantic methods towards our new {EI} system approach. The second part presents the case study for the diagnosis of the cluster structure. Hence, we applied our theoretical schema to the project: specifically dedicated to nanometrology cluster in France, (or 'Club {nanoMétrologie}', club-nanometrologie.fr), gathering both academic labs and industries. Processing with {NooJ} [25],[26] is (i) to mine on actors linked to information needs in order to get the better management of the project and (ii) to determine interactions between actors in the cluster.},

	abstract = {Online marketplaces often contain information not only about products, but also about the people selling the products. In an effort to facilitate trust, many platforms encourage sellers to provide personal profiles and even to post pictures of themselves. However, these features may also facilitate discrimination based on sellers’ race, gender, age, or other aspects of appearance. In this paper, we test for racial discrimination against landlords in the online rental marketplace Airbnb. Using a new data set combining pictures of all New York City landlords on Airbnb with their rental prices and information about quality of the rentals, we show that non-black hosts charge approximately 12\% more than black hosts for the equivalent rental. These effects are robust when controlling for all information visible in the Airbnb marketplace. These findings highlight the prevalence of discrimination in online marketplaces, suggesting an important unintended consequence of a seemingly-routine mechanism for building trust.},

Important opportunities exist for understanding future changes in sales concentration patterns; the impact on supply chains (including cross-channel competition, competition within the Internet channel, implications for the growth of firms, and the balance of power within the supply chain); implications for pricing, promotion, and product design; and, ultimately, the potential effects on society in general.

Drawing from a controversial case of a highly innovative information system in an insurance company-considered a success and failure at the same time- the paper reveals the inherent indeterminacy of {IS} success and failure and describes the mechanisms by which success and failure become performed and thus determined by sociomaterial practices. This is explained by exposing ontological politics in the reconfiguration and decomposition of the {IS} project actor-network and the emergence of different agencies of assessment that performed both different {IS} realities and competing {IS} assessments. The analysis shows that the {IS} project and the implemented system as objects of assessment are not given and fixed, but are performed by the agencies of assessment together with the assessment outcomes of success and failure. The paper demonstrates that by reframing {IS} success and failure, the performative perspective provides some novel and surprising insights that have a potential to change conversations on {IS} assessments in both the {IS} literature and {IS} practice.},

Wikipedia was created through a tremendous number of contributions by millions of contributors. However, recent research has shown that the number of active contributors in Wikipedia has been declining steadily for years and suggests that a sharp decline in the retention of newcomers is the cause. This article presents data that show how several changes the Wikipedia community made to manage quality and consistency in the face of a massive growth in participation have ironically crippled the very growth they were designed to manage. Specifically, the restrictiveness of the encyclopedia’s primary quality control mechanism and the algorithmic tools used to reject contributions are implicated as key causes of decreased newcomer retention. Furthermore, the community’s formal mechanisms for norm articulation are shown to have calcified against changes—especially changes proposed by newer editors.},

An exploratory multi-case study was conducted with the participation of {POI} intermediaries and local governments in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. The eight cases reveal that certain public or private companies act as a bridge – {POI} intermediary – across the large cognitive distances between city halls and a network of organisations, while orchestrating the collaboration of actors and executing innovation projects. These findings motivate policy makers to enhance the innovativeness and competitiveness of cities, and they offer useful guidelines for city halls to improve their innovation process and remove possible obstacles.},

It also looks at whether {FOI} has affected local leadership, service delivery and partnership work. {FOI} has not had a “transformative” impact on local government. Local authorities are more transparent, supported by new online disclosure reforms. {FOI} has also increased accountability but only increased public understanding in a small way. It has had no effect on decision-making except in particularly sensitive issues. It has not increased participation and has had no general impact upon trust. Core activities remain unaffected though private contractors’ information and media use cause concern. The variable openness of institutions depends on context, culture and political leadership. The diversity is also driven by requesters’ varying motivations.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to describe a public procurement information platform which provides a unified pan-European system that exploits the aggregation of tender notices using linking open data and semantic web technologies. This platform requires a step-based method to deal with the requirements of the public procurement sector and the open government data initiative: (1) modeling the unstructured information included in public procurement notices (contracting authorities, organizations, contracts awarded, etc.); (2) enriching that information with the existing product classification systems and the linked data vocabularies; (3) publishing relevant information extracted out of the notices following the linking open data approach; (4) implementing enhanced services based on advanced algorithms and techniques like query expansion methods to exploit the information in a semantic way. Taking into account that public procurement notices contain different kinds of data like types of contract, region, duration, total amount, target enterprise, etc., various methods can be applied to expand user queries easing the access to the information and providing a more accurate information retrieval system. Nevertheless expanded user queries can involve an extra-time in the process of retrieving notices. That is why a performance evaluation is outlined to tune up the semantic methods and the generated queries providing a scalable and time-efficient system. Moreover, this platform is supposed to be especially relevant for {SMEs} that want to tender in the European Union ({EU}), easing their access to the information of the notices and fostering their participation in cross-border public procurement processes across Europe. Finally an example of use is provided to evaluate and compare the goodness and the improvement of the proposed platform with regard to the existing ones.},

Currently there is a multiplicity of open data policies at various levels of government, whereas very little systematic and structured research has been done on the issues that are covered by open data policies, their intent and actual impact. Furthermore, no suitable framework for comparing open data policies is available, as open data is a recent phenomenon and is thus in an early stage of development. In order to help bring about a better understanding of the common and differentiating elements in the policies and to identify the factors affecting the variation in policies, this paper develops a framework for comparing open data policies. The framework includes the factors of environment and context, policy content, performance indicators and public values. Using this framework, seven Dutch governmental policies at different government levels are compared. The comparison shows both similarities and differences among open data policies, providing opportunities to learn from each other's policies. The findings suggest that current policies are rather inward looking, open data policies can be improved by collaborating with other organizations, focusing on the impact of the policy, stimulating the use of open data and looking at the need to create a culture in which publicizing data is incorporated in daily working processes. The findings could contribute to the development of new open data policies and the improvement of existing open data policies.},

Although considerable attention has been paid to the legal and economic aspects of policies on public sector information ({PSI}), also known as open data ({OD}), the organizational consequences regarding the nature and shape of the public sector are rarely anticipated. We develop a framework to analyse organizational settings by comparing policies and outcomes of {PSI} reuse in {EU} member states. In many discussions on {PSI} reuse, government is treated as a unitary phenomenon with a single voice. We found considerable differences among {EU} member states concerning the implementation of {PSI} policies and indications that they are connected with the nature of the public sector in a specific state. Therefore we suggest that policies on {PSI} reuse to stimulate economic prosperity should be developed which take the specific national setting into consideration. When national government develops policies aimed simply at disclosing {PSI} without paying attention to the development of {PSI} reuse arenas, it runs the risk of unleashing narratives of control within the public sector, preventing them from releasing the innovative potential that {PSI} reuse intrinsically possesses.},

They can make better predictions and smarter decisions. They can target more-effective interventions in areas that so far have been dominated by gut and intuition rather than by data and rigor. The differences between big data and analytics are a matter of volume, velocity, and variety: More data now cross the internet every second than were stored in the entire internet 20 years ago. Nearly real-time information makes it possible for a company to be much more agile than its competitors. And that information can come from social networks, images, sensors, the web, or other unstructured sources. The managerial challenges, however, are very real. Senior decision makers have to learn to ask the right questions and embrace evidence-based decision making. Organizations must hire scientists who can find patterns in very large data sets and translate them into useful business information. {IT} departments have to work hard to integrate all the relevant internal and external sources of data. The authors offer two success stories to illustrate how companies are using big data: {PASSUR} Aerospace enables airlines to match their actual and estimated arrival times.

As a Jesuit, Potron was largely influenced by the ‘social doctrine of justice’. Consequently, he was mainly concerned with social justice and economic efficiency, problems of ‘fairness’, and the setting of ‘fair prices’ and ‘fair wages’.

	abstract = {This study explores the role of customers' social network in their defection from a service provider. The authors use data on communication among one million customers of a cellular company to create a large-scale social system composed of customers' individual social networks. The study's results indicate that exposure to a defecting neighbor is associated with an increase of 80\% in the defection hazard, after controlling for a host of social, personal, and purchase-related variables. This effect is comparable in both magnitude and nature to social effects observed in the highly researched case of product adoption: The extent of social influence on retention decays exponentially over time, and the likelihood of defection is affected by tie strength and homophily with defecting neighbors and by these neighbors' average number of connections. Highly connected customers are more affected, and loyal customers are less affected by defections that occur in their social networks. These results carry important implications for the theoretical understanding of the drivers of customer retention and should be considered by firms that aim to predict and affect customer retention.

This article investigates whether this difference in goals influences satisfaction with an outcome that was either self-chosen or externally determined. In four experiments we manipulate consumption goals, controlling for the outcomes, the option valence, and whether the externally made choice was determined by an expert or at random. Results show that the outcome of a self-made choice is more satisfying than the outcome of an externally made choice when the goal is hedonic but not when it is utilitarian. We hypothesize that this effect results from the greater perceived personal causality associated with terminally motivated activities, such as hedonic choices, relative to instrumentally motivated activities, such as utilitarian choices, and provide evidence that supports this explanation over alternative accounts.},

Studies in marketing have found that one particular customer metric, customer satisfaction, improves the ability to predict future cash flows, long-term financial measures, stock performance, and shareholder value. However, most of these studies predominantly employ models that are not directly used in finance practice. This article extends existing literature by examining the impact of customer satisfaction on firm valuation by employing multiples and risk-adjusted abnormal return models borrowed directly from the practice of finance. Data include 3600 firm-quarter observations from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, {COMPUSTAT}, and Center for Research in Securities Prices databases from 1996 to 2006. The results indicate that a portfolio of stocks consisting of firms with high levels and positive changes in customer satisfaction will outperform the other three possible portfolio combinations (low levels and negative changes, low levels and positive changes, and high levels and negative changes in customer satisfaction) along with Standard \& Poor's 500. Initially, the stock market undervalues positive satisfaction information, but the market adjusts in the long run. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

However, there has been little in-depth research into the nature of this relation, in particular in the context of B2B relations. In the sphere of an organization providing financial intermediation services to the banking sector and on the basis of a literature review, hypotheses are developed which establish the mediator role of service value and the moderator role of job satisfaction of service employees when delimiting customer satisfaction. Reliability and validity analysis give satisfactory results and our conclusions establish firstly that service encounter directly and significantly affects perceived service value which is the final antecedent to customer satisfaction and secondly, that the level of employment satisfaction moderates its effect on service value.

Without questioning the suitability of the tetra-class model for classifying services, the authors have studied the nature of the changes in categories of services for three client-based variables and two variables linked to the service relationship. The results indicate that there are degrees of variability that alter in importance from one client segment to another and also with respect to the particular service under consideration.Journal of Targeting, Measurement and Analysis for Marketing (2006) 15, 30–46. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jt.5750032 [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

The authors show that customer satisfaction exhibits a significant and negative relationship to buyer loyalty. Also buyer loyalty is shown to exhibit a significant and positive relationship with market share. However, satisfaction is found to have no direct effects on market share. Additionally, satisfaction has no indirect effect on share through the mediation effects of buyer loyalty. Finally, the covariate, type of retail store, is found to be related to satisfaction and loyalty, but not to market share. Thus, the levels of consumer satisfaction and loyalty differ across retail categories. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

In contrast to the disconfirmation of expectations model of satisfaction, we find that, although regulatory focus does affect consumers' expectations, the effect on satisfaction cannot be explained by differences in those expectations. Instead, our results reveal a direct effect of consumers' regulatory focus on satisfaction that is based on the conservative bias of prevention-focused consumers. Compared to promotion-focused consumers, prevention-focused consumers protect against making errors and demonstrate a conservative bias in their evaluations of satisfaction. The results of two experiments demonstrate this conservative bias, showing that, compared to promotion-focused consumers, prevention-focused consumers are less satisfied with positive outcomes and more satisfied with negative outcomes},

The study intends to fill that void by conducting a meta-analysis of empirical findings on the predictors of customer loyalty. Although findings of this study support all the hypothesized main effects, they indicate stronger effect size for trust than for other determinants of loyalty. The study also tests the robustness of previous findings across various research and measurement contexts. The analysis of moderating effects reveals several interesting findings. For instance, attitudinal loyalty measures seem to be a plausible surrogate for behavioral loyalty measures. The effects of customer satisfaction and trust on loyalty are less prominent when products are purchased on a regular and relatively short (as opposed to an irregular and relatively long) purchase cycle. Factors that largely relate to product performance (e.g., satisfaction, quality) have a weaker impact on loyalty in B2B than in B2C settings. Some relationships (e.g., the effect of quality on loyalty) become stronger over time. Furthermore, our results detect consistently weaker effects from studies using single-item (relative to multi-item) loyalty measures},

Based on a large-scale secondary data set, the results show support for this framework. Notably, the authors find that in firms with low innovativeness capability, {CSR} actually reduces customer satisfaction levels and, through the lowered satisfaction, harms market value.

The theoretical model has been applied in three service settings. It was found that all three components of commitment have the potential to drive customer willingness to give favorable recommendations about the service provider. Affective commitment is the most significant determinant of customer advocacy, but normative commitment also plays a supporting and positive role. Continuance commitment undermines customer willingness to be an advocate. The conclusion is that the forces that create strong service provider–customer relationships can provide the additional benefit of customer advocacy of the service provider.},

While most research focuses on how customer satisfaction contributes to the firm's profitability, financial resources required to implement satisfaction programs are largely ignored in the literature. This paper takes a conceptual middle ground, proposing that customer satisfaction influences profitability, and at the same time, profitability impacts satisfaction. However, based on recent evidence (Rust, Moorman and Dickson, 2002), we propose that there is a lagged effect between the two. In other words, past satisfaction has a positive effect on current profitability, and similarly, past profitability affects current satisfaction. Furthermore, event study methodology is utilized to examine stock reaction to the announcement of the firm's satisfaction performance, solidifying the relationship between satisfaction, a marketing metric, and financial performance.

Adopting the view that customer satisfaction is a stochastic marketplace asset, the authors advance a mean-variance perspective that enables them to test two conjectures: (1) Objective service quality and advertising affect not only the level of customer satisfaction but also the heterogeneity in customer satisfaction, and (2) shareholder value is shaped by the interplay of satisfaction level and heterogeneity, through their impact on retention sales, acquisition sales, and servicing costs. The authors test these conjectures using secondary data from diverse sources that describe the dynamics in the U.S. airlines industry during a nine-year period (1997–2005). The results, derived from estimating structural models that account for the impact of several meaningful control variables, provide strong support for both conjectures. Importantly, the findings indicate that the return on satisfaction to shareholder value decreases by almost 70\% in going from low to high satisfaction heterogeneity; at the same time, increasing levels of satisfaction heterogeneity serves to reduce the volatility in shareholder value},

Results show that current customer satisfaction performance is negatively related to both net income and total assets, while past satisfaction is positively related to net income, but bears no relationship to total assets.

Design/methodology/approach — Structural equation models of data from a survey to customers of a performing arts organization (sample size = 401) are used to test the hypotheses. Findings — The study suggests that commitment has a positive influence on customer satisfaction and diminishes risk perceptions. There is less support for a model in which satisfaction increases commitment and reduces perceived risk. Originality/value — There has been recent controversy as to whether customer satisfaction leads to customer loyalty.

It was hypothesized and found that males' satisfaction is dependent on their ability to impose their preferences on their female counterpart within a mixed-gender dyad. In contrast, females' satisfaction is only affected by the degree to which dyad members behave cooperatively. The model is tested within the context of 76 mixed-gender dyads that are in an established relationship. The dyads are sampled from shoppers at a national retailer, and report on their decision-making process as they exit the store. A partial-least-squares ({PLS}) methodology is used to test for differences in the effects of cooperative and competitive behaviors on males' and females' satisfaction with a dyadic decision.

Getting returns from service quality: Revenue expansion, cost reduction, or both. J. Marketing 66(October) 7-24.) to examine the association between customer satisfaction and long-term financial performance among firms that achieve a dual emphasis (focusing on both revenue-expansion and cost-reduction simultaneously, rather than solely emphasizing one over the other). Using a longitudinal data set of 77 firms from the United States, we test this hypothesis and find that the association between customer satisfaction and long-term financial performance is positive and relatively stronger for firms that successfully achieve a dual emphasis. We build on the work of Rust, Moorman, and Dickson (2002), who investigated the financial impact of engaging in the process of achieving a dual emphasis. Collectively, these studies show that while achieving a dual emphasis is desirable for long-run financial success, the process of achieving a dual emphasis may not be as financially rewarding in the short run. Firms pursuing a dual emphasis need to consider both short- and long-term consequences of their strategy. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

A comprehensive data set obtained from the sponsors of the Chinese Customer Satisfaction Index provides the input for a flexible cubic regression configuration to model the functional forms. The linear functional form emerges as the most prominent across 972 product–customer segments (51\%), followed in frequency by the S-shaped and convex forms and, finally, the inverse S-shape and concave forms. Different product category characteristics, customer economic and demographic variables, and market characteristics moderate the effect of satisfaction on repurchase intentions differently for the linear, quadratic, and cubic terms. This research reveals key resource allocation implications based on the functional forms of the effect of satisfaction on repurchase intentions, as well as strategic segmentation implications related to the varying influence of product category characteristics, customer economic and demographic variables, and market characteristics},

Drawing on the appraisal theories of emotion and on social comparison theory, an experiment (n =272) and a field study (n =261) are conducted. The results reveal that in advantaged price inequality situations, customers experience a host of positive and negative emotions depending on two factors: the quality of relationship that the customer has with a disadvantaged other customer (neutral, positive, or negative) and the attribution of agency for the price advantage (situational attribution to competition, external attribution to store policies, or internal attribution to customer abilities). Positive emotions include happiness, gratitude, pride, and malicious joy; while negative emotions include pity, outrage, and guilt. These emotions are shown to mediate the occurrence of customer reactions (i.e., customer satisfaction, loyalty, {WOM} referral, and {WOM} activity).

Results suggest that satisfaction is higher for men when they perceive an elevated level of functional service quality and for women when they perceive that the theatre possesses pro-social values. Satisfaction overlap exists when either men or women perceive market or artistic values. Existing literature has suggested that women begin elaboration of message cues at a lower threshold than men; however, it appears that a zone exists where both sexes elaborate on some image attributes, while women further elaborate on communal attributes and men focus on agentic attributes. Contrary to prevailing evidence in the services management literature, no direct link surfaced between perceived quality of the core service and customer satisfaction. Post hoc tests for mediation indicate that tangible quality of the core service is important to both men and women, driving their engagement in elaboration of image attributes, but it is not important enough to directly stimulate satisfaction when other factors of the consumption experience are taken into account in complex encounters.

Based on an industrial company''s key account relationships, the portfolio approach considered in this study employs Customer Satisfaction ({CS}) metrics as a portfolio dimension and suggests a new and more customer oriented approach to account portfolio analysis. Proposed portfolio matrices provide insights into the strength and stability of customer relationships. Furthermore, the matrices force managers to adopt a future perspective on customer relationships by evaluating the business potential of customers along with {CS} information and allow prioritization with respect to resource allocation. The study attempts to put forward customer heterogeneity in industrial markets and offers a managerial guideline embracing customer specific marketing actions. In addition, the paper proposes a new use for {CS} information in strategic decision making. [Copyright 2009 Elsevier]},

On the basis of longitudinal analyses of large-scale secondary data from multiple sources, the authors find that customer satisfaction boosts the efficiency of future advertising and promotion investments. This finding can be explained by the possibility that customer satisfaction generates free word-of-mouth advertising and saves subsequent marketing costs. In addition, customer satisfaction has a positive influence on a company's excellence in human capital (employee talent and manager superiority). This finding is highly novel, indicating that human resources managers should have a strong interest in customer satisfaction as well. Finally, the authors investigate the moderating influence of market concentration on both relationships. The uncovered results have important implications for marketers in their dialogue with financial executives and human resources managers. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

Design/methodology/approach - Three hypotheses are tested. They are as follows. Sales people who perceive that the information is inaccurate will be less likely to: have a positive perception of the system; think that their training was helpful; and think that the system improves their productivity. Chi-square tests are used to test the association between the perceptions of information accuracy and the statements in the hypotheses. Findings - Negative perceptions about the accuracy of information leads to negative perceptions about other aspects of the {SFA} system. Research limitations/implications - This study examines the results for only one particular organization. The results may not be generalizable to other organizations. As similar data about other {SFA} systems become available, this study can be used as a basis for examining the effect of information accuracy on perceptions of {SFA} systems. Originality/value - Since the company has some control over the accuracy of the information provided by the system, they should attempt to provide information that the salesforce finds useful. To enure that the proper information is provided, management must seek the user's input about what information should be provided.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper examines customer attitudes to value, show experience quality and peripheral service quality in a high arts setting by using a questionnaire. The pool of questions used the most recent scale measures for constructs in the area of services, in particular experiential services. The data are tested using {AMOS} 5.0 structural equation modelling. Findings - This paper reports that value mediates the relationship of show experience quality and peripheral service quality to satisfaction and the direct link of these pathways to satisfaction was not significant. This research supports the notion that customers determine service satisfaction based on attribute performance of the show and peripheral service aspects, and derive value from this. Practical implications - This research informs cultural organisation managers of the importance of delivering high levels of service quality and show experience in order to offer a value for money experience. This paper identifies the importance of understanding the heterogeneous and complex nature of customer-derived value. Originality/value - This paper examines a service sector that receives little attention. Cultural organisations operate as non-profit organisations and are accountable for scarce fund allocation. Government support has decreased and corporate sponsorship is scarce and competitive. This paper offers assistance to organisations in the quest to balance the economic issues and constraints by creating value and satisfaction and balancing service quality and show delivery.

	abstract = {This study investigates how people's satisfaction judgments are modified after they interact with other group members. It integrates research on customer satisfaction and social influence to develop hypotheses about how an individual's satisfaction is influenced by discrepancies between her expectations about the satisfaction of other group members and their actual opinions as revealed in group discussion. It also considers how this effect is moderated by the individual's susceptibility to social influence and perceptions of group cohesiveness. Two empirical studies demonstrate significant social influence effects on satisfaction judgments in groups. Study One analyzes group satisfaction data collected over time using a mixed-effects regression. It shows that an individual's perceived discrepancy between others satisfaction judgments and expected group satisfaction has an important influence on her postdiscussion satisfaction judgments. Moreover, individuals discount the prediscussion satisfaction judgments of other group members in favor of perceived satisfaction and its discrepancy with expectations. Group cohesiveness accentuates the perceived discrepancy with expected group satisfaction.Study Two analyzes survey data from dyads drawn from a cross-sectional sample of organizational buyers who purchase from the same supplier. It models the decision maker's satisfaction with a service supplier as a function of end-user satisfaction. It shows that social influence effects exist in purchasing groups within organizations. Both studies demonstrate that individual-level postdiscussion satisfaction judgments tend to become more extreme, a phenomenon we call satisfaction escalation. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

	abstract = {This paper brings together two bodies of literature. One of them is a literature on the special role of the consumer in retailing. The other one is the literature on customer satisfaction. This joining of literatures is accomplished by identifying distribution services as outputs of retail firms and fixed inputs into the production functions of consumers and relaxing the standard assumption that the demand for these services is always equal to the supply of these services. The result is a new conceptual framework for the analysis of customer satisfaction in retailing. This framework extends the basic ideas on customer satisfaction developed for manufacturing in a homogeneous single product setting to the heterogeneous multi-product setting relevant for many retailers. The paper illustrates one approach to the implementation of this framework with data for a set of supermarkets in Pamplona, Spain, that measure distribution services by asking consumers questions explicitly identifying these services. The five main categories of distribution services identified by the conceptual framework and measured in the data are economically important and statistically robust determinants of customer satisfaction with supermarkets. These results are obtained controlling for other variables typical of the customer satisfaction literature and measuring customer satisfaction in a manner consistent with that literature. The results are robust to corrections for sample selection and alternative estimation methods. Perhaps our most interesting novel result is that the effect of the determinants of customer satisfaction on future purchase intentions in the supermarket case is different when measured directly in a one stage process than when measured indirectly in a two stage process through the attributes/satisfaction/ purchase intentions chain.

This research note is a summary of our findings on the Paris market. Our study shows different growth and seasonality patterns for Airbnb and hotels and dissimilarities in the geographical location of the offers. The findings indicate that the two products are not in direct competition and that their relationship might be more complex than previously thought.

	abstract = {Purpose Vast volumes of rich online consumer-generated content ({CGC}) can be used effectively to gain important insights for decision-making, product improvement and brand management. Recently, many studies have proposed semi-supervised aspect-based sentiment classification of unstructured {CGC}. However, most of the existing {CGC} mining methods rely on explicitly detecting aspect-based sentiments and overlooking the context of sentiment-bearing words. Therefore, this study aims to extract implicit context-sensitive sentiment, and handle slangs, ambiguous, informal and special words used in {CGC}. Design/methodology/approach A novel text mining framework is proposed to detect and evaluate implicit semantic word relations and context. First, {POS} (part of speech) tagging is used for detecting aspect descriptions and sentiment-bearing words. Then, {LDA} (latent Dirichlet allocation) is used to group similar aspects together and to form an attribute. Semantically and contextually similar words are found using the skip-gram model for distributed word vectorisation. Finally, to find context-sensitive sentiment of each attribute, cosine similarity is used along with a set of positive and negative seed words. Findings Experimental results using more than 400,000 Amazon mobile phone reviews showed that the proposed method efficiently found product attributes and corresponding context-aware sentiments. This method also outperforms the classification accuracy of the baseline model and state-of-the-art techniques using context-sensitive information on data sets from two different domains. Practical implications Extracted attributes can be easily classified into consumer issues and brand merits. A brand-based comparative study is presented to demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed approach. Originality/value This paper presents a novel method for context-sensitive attribute-based sentiment analysis of {CGC}, which is useful for both brand and product improvement.},

It compares users’ emotions before and after the launch of three new products in the market—a pizza, a car and a smart phone—for possible inputs for {NPD}. The user-generated content offers an alternative to conventional survey data and is cross-cultural in nature, relatively inexpensive and provides real-time information about user behaviour. A total of 302,632 tweets that mentioned the three new products before and after the launch were collected and analysed. Sentiment analysis of the tweets from two time periods was conducted and compared. The users’ responses to the pre- and post-launch of three products vary. The dissatisfaction with the new products represented by negative emotions aligns with the market performance. In the pre-launch period, trust and joy were more common for pizza, joy was more common for the car, and trust was more common for the phone. In the post-launch period, anger and disgust were more common for pizza, joy and trust were more common for the car, and joy was more common for only one aspect of the phone. Further analysis showed that for the car and the phone, firms need to focus on user attitudes towards product attributes, whereas for pizza, firms should concentrate on physiological changes, i.e., changes in product attributes, service and promotional sides. By using the proposed alternative approach, businesses can obtain real-time feedback about the expectations and experiences of the new products. The {NPD} process can be adjusted accordingly.},

Studying protest repression requires appropriate datasets. Existing datasets like {GDELT} focus mainly on events reported in news media. However, news media reports have issues including censorship and coverage bias. Recently, social scientists have started using Machine Learning ({ML}) to detect political events, but it is costly and time consuming to hand label data for training {ML} models. This paper proposes using {ML} and crowdsourcing to detect protest repression events from Twitter. Our case study is the Turkish Gezi Park protest in 2013. Our results show that Twitter is a reliable source reﬂecting events happening on the ground as soon as they happen. Moreover, training conventional {ML} models on crowdsourced labelled data gave good results with an {AUC} score of 0.896 to detect protest events and 0.8189 to detect repression events.},

To date, most studies have tested the significance of predefined factors thought to influence user satisfaction, with no scalable means of verifying the validity of their assumptions. Digital technology has created new methods of collecting user feedback where service users post comments. As topic models can analyse large volumes of feedback, they have been proposed as a feasible approach to aggregating user opinions. This novel approach has been applied to process reviews of primary care practices in England. Findings from an analysis of more than 200,000 reviews show that the quality of interactions with staff and bureaucratic exigencies are the key drivers of user satisfaction. In addition, patient satisfaction is strongly influenced by factors that are not measured by state-ofthe-art patient surveys.

These developments are to be applauded as they bring about novel insights about politics using new sources of (unstructured) data. However, a divide exists between work in both disciplines using text as data. In this paper we argue in favor of more integration across disciplinary boundaries, structuring our case around four key issues in the research process: (i) sampling text; (ii) authorship as meta data; (iii) pre-processing text; (iv) analyzing text. Along the way we demonstrate that an assessment of speaker characteristics may crucially depend on the text sources under study, and that the use of sentiment words correlates with estimates of policy positions, with implications for interpretation of the latter. As such, this paper contributes to a critical discussion about the merits of automated text analysis methods in political psychology and political science, with an eye towards advancing the considerable potential of text as data in the study of politics.},

This article aims to acquaint organizational researchers with the fundamental logic underpinning text mining, the analytical stages involved, and contemporary techniques that may be used to achieve different types of objectives. The specific analytical techniques reviewed are (a) dimensionality reduction, (b) distance and similarity computing, (c) clustering, (d) topic modeling, and (e) classification. We describe how text mining may extend contemporary organizational research by allowing the testing of existing or new research questions with data that are likely to be rich, contextualized, and ecologically valid.

This supply of text has elicited demand for natural language processing and machine learning tools to ﬁlter, search, and translate text into valuable data. We survey some of the most exciting computational approaches to text analysis, highlighting both supervised methods that extend old theories to new data and unsupervised techniques that discover hidden regularities worth theorizing. We then review recent research that uses these tools to develop social insight by exploring (a) collective attention and reasoning through the content of communication; (b) social relationships through the process of communication; and (c) social states, roles, and moves identiﬁed through heterogeneous signals within communication. We highlight social questions for which these advances could offer powerful new insight.},

By relying on a cognitive‐linguistic perspective, we investigate whether firms respond to their own irresponsible business conduct by changing their {CSR} reports' linguistic features and, if so, how. We use a sample of 135 large corporations headquartered in developed countries between 1995 and 2014. An analysis of their {CSR} reports reveals that the more a firm is involved in irresponsible business conduct, the more likely it is to use narrative (instead of analytical) and deceptive (instead of authentic) language. Moreover, we show that these two trends are particularly evident for highly internationalised firms.},

	abstract = {Background: Gastrointestinal ({GI}) discomfort is prevalent and known to be associated with impaired quality of life. Real-world information on factors of {GI} discomfort and solutions used by people is, however, limited. Social media, including online forums, have been considered a new source of information to examine the health of populations in real-life settings. Objective: The aims of this retrospective infodemiology study are to identify discussion topics, characterize users, and identify perceived determinants of {GI} discomfort in web-based messages posted by users of French social media. Methods: Messages related to {GI} discomfort posted between January 2003 and August 2018 were extracted from 14 French-speaking general and specialized publicly available online forums. Extracted messages were cleaned and deidentified. Relevant medical concepts were determined on the basis of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and vernacular terms. The identification of discussion topics was carried out by using a correlated topic model on the basis of the latent Dirichlet allocation. A nonsupervised clustering algorithm was applied to cluster forum users according to the reported symptoms of {GI} discomfort, discussion topics, and activity on online forums. Users’ age and gender were determined by linear regression and application of a support vector machine, respectively, to characterize the identified clusters according to demographic parameters. Perceived factors of {GI} discomfort were classified by a combined method on the basis of syntactic analysis to identify messages with causality terms and a second topic modeling in a relevant segment of phrases. Results: A total of 198,866 messages associated with {GI} discomfort were included in the analysis corpus after extraction and cleaning. These messages were posted by 36,989 separate web users, most of them being women younger than 40 years. Everyday life, diet, digestion, abdominal pain, impact on the quality of life, and tips to manage stress were among the most discussed topics. Segmentation of users identified 5 clusters corresponding to chronic and acute {GI} concerns. Diet topic was associated with each cluster, and stress was strongly associated with abdominal pain. Psychological factors, food, and allergens were perceived as the main causes of {GI} discomfort by web users. Conclusions: {GI} discomfort is actively discussed by web users. This study reveals a complex relationship between food, stress, and {GI} discomfort. Our approach has shown that identifying web-based discussion topics associated with {GI} discomfort and its perceived factors is feasible and can serve as a complementary source of real-world evidence for caregivers.},

The authors discuss how text reflects qualities of the text producer (and the context in which the text was produced) and impacts the audience or text recipient. Next, they discuss how text can be a powerful tool both for prediction and for understanding (i.e., insights). Then, the authors overview methodologies and metrics used in text analysis, providing a set of guidelines and procedures. Finally, they further highlight some common metrics and challenges and discuss how researchers can address issues of internal and external validity. They conclude with a discussion of potential areas for future work. Along the way, the authors note how textual analysis can unite the tribes of marketing. While most marketing problems are interdisciplinary, the field is often fragmented. By involving skills and ideas from each of the subareas of marketing, text analysis has the potential to help unite the field with a common set of tools and approaches.},

Many clinical questions cannot be fully answered by evidence derived from quantitative or qualitative research designs alone, since many areas in healthcare are supported by clinicians’ tacit knowledge derived from their clinical experiences. In this situation, evidence generated from a systematic review of text and opinion may be required as the best available evidence. The aim of this study is to highlight the importance and role of expert opinion synthesis in healthcare, and present results of an international methodological group review. Methods: A methodological group was formed to review this approach, and update the guidance and processes for undertaking a systematic review of text and opinion. Results: The methodology of systematic reviews of text and opinion had already been developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. We reviewed and updated several steps in the process, such as inclusion criteria, search strategy, critical appraisal and data extraction. Conclusions: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for the systematic review of text and opinion is unique, and continuously evolving and being further developed. Systematic reviews of text and opinion may be considered as legitimate sources of evidence, especially when there is an absence of other research designs.},

	abstract = {Smartphones have made it nearly effortless to share images of branded experiences. This research classiﬁes social media brand imagery and studies user response. Aside from packshots (standalone product images), two types of brand-related selﬁe images appear online: consumer selﬁes (featuring brands and consumers’ faces) and an emerging phenomenon the authors term “brand selﬁes” (invisible consumers holding a branded product). The authors use convolutional neural networks to identify these archetypes and train language models to infer social media response to more than a quarter-million brand-image posts (185 brands on Twitter and Instagram). They ﬁnd that consumer-selﬁe images receive more sender engagement (i.e., likes and comments), whereas brand selﬁes result in more brand engagement, expressed by purchase intentions. These results cast doubt on whether conventional social media metrics are appropriate indicators of brand engagement. Results for display ads are consistent with this observation, with higher click-through rates for brand selﬁes than for consumer selﬁes. A controlled lab experiment suggests that self-reference is driving the differential response to selﬁe images. Collectively, these results demonstrate how (interpretable) machine learning helps extract marketing-relevant information from unstructured multimedia content and that selﬁe images are a matter of perspective in terms of actual brand engagement.},

Current approaches extractively select portions of web text as input to Sequence-to-Sequence models using methods such as {TF}-{IDF} ranking. We propose constructing a local graph structured knowledge base for each query, which compresses the web search information and reduces redundancy. We show that by linearizing the graph into a structured input sequence, models can encode the graph representations within a standard Sequence-to-Sequence setting. For two generative tasks with very long text input, long-form question answering and multidocument summarization, feeding graph representations as input can achieve better performance than using retrieved text portions.},

	abstract = {Little empirical research about conspiracy theories ({CT}) has been conducted in psychology. By conspiracy theory we mean a lay theory about socially significant and negative events (i.e. assassinations, terrorist attacks, etc.), which often implies the intervention of one or more groups acting in secret, and contradicting the official account of the event. In this paper, we address two research questions: (1) Is the belief in conspiracy theories a single dimension, or is it possible to disentangle several subdimensions??? (2) Which variables are likely to predict this belief? In a questionnaire submitted to 198 university students, we identified two partially distinct categories of conspiracy theories: (1) {CTs} which blame authorities (the system) and (2) the {CTs} which accuse a minority (e.g. Jews, Muslim terrorists). Finally, we showed that fear and distrust predicted the two types of {CTs}. Moreover, irrationality specifically predicted the belief in the System {CTs}, whereas political conservatism predicted the belief in the Minority {CTs}.},

We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}), a generative probabilistic topic model, to exhibit highly-speciﬁc query-related topics from pseudo-relevant feedback documents. Our approach automatically estimates the number of latent concepts as well as the needed amount of feedback documents, without any prior training step. Latent concepts are then weighted to reﬂect their relative adequacy and are further used to automatically reformulate the initial user query. We also explore the use of different types of sources of information for modeling the latent concepts. For this purpose, we use four general sources of information of various nature (web, news, encyclopedic) from which the feedback documents are extracted. We evaluate our approach over two large ad-hoc {TREC} collections, and results show that it significantly improves document retrieval effectiveness while best results are achieved by combining latent concepts modeled from all available sources.},

We view big data as a disruption to the value chain that has widespread impacts, which include but are not limited to changing the way academics conduct scholarly work.

When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-ofthe-art performance, with human listeners rating it as signiﬁcantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single {WaveNet} can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal ﬁdelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we ﬁnd that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

	abstract = {The increasing volume of ﬁrm-related conversations on social media has made it considerably more difﬁcult for marketers to track and analyse electronic word-of-mouth ({eWOM}) about brands, products or services. Firms often use sentiment analysis to identify relevant {eWOM} that requires a response to consequently engage in webcare. In this paper, we show that sentiment analysis of any kind might not be ideal for this purpose, because it relies on the questionable assumption that only negative {eWOM} is response-worthy and it is not able to infer meaning from text. We propose and test an approach based on supervised machine learning that ﬁrst decides whether {eWOM} is relevant for the brand to respond, and then—based on a categorization of seven different types of {eWOM} (e.g., question, complaint)—classiﬁes three customer satisfaction dimensions. Using a dataset of approximately 60,000 Facebook comments and 11,000 tweets about 16 different brands in eight different industries, we test and compare the efﬁcacy of various sentiment analysis, dictionary-based and machine learning techniques to detect relevant {eWOM}. In doing so, this study identiﬁes response-worthy {eWOM} based on the content instead of its expressed sentiment. The results indicate that these machine learning techniques achieve considerably higher accuracy in detecting relevant {eWOM} on social media compared to any kind of sentiment analysis. Moreover, it is shown that industry-speciﬁc classiﬁers can further improve this process and that algorithms are applicable across different social networks.},

I use the language of Bayesian inference to describe this bias, and show that it can lead to a runaway effect in which the weight given to the prior expectation associated with a candidate's class becomes stronger with each round. Most dramatically, the strength of the prestige bias after many rounds undergoes a first-order transition as a function of the precision of the examination on which the evaluation is based.},

Since data collection for machine learning models for this task is time-consuming, it is desirable to make use of existing data in a high-resource language to train models in low-resource languages. However, development of such models has largely been hindered by the lack of multilingual training data. In this paper, we present a new data set of 57k annotated utterances in English (43k), Spanish (8.6k) and Thai (5k) across the domains weather, alarm, and reminder. We use this data set to evaluate three different cross-lingual transfer methods: (1) translating the training data, (2) using cross-lingual pre-trained embeddings, and (3) a novel method of using a multilingual machine translation encoder as contextual word representations. We ﬁnd that given several hundred training examples in the the target language, the latter two methods outperform translating the training data. Further, in very low-resource settings, multilingual contextual word representations give better results than using cross-lingual static embeddings. We also compare the cross-lingual methods to using monolingual resources in the form of contextual {ELMo} representations and ﬁnd that given just small amounts of target language data, this method outperforms all cross-lingual methods, which highlights the need for more sophisticated cross-lingual methods.},

Moreover, most of the existing sentiment analysis methods are based on clean data. In this paper, we present {DICET} , a transformer-based method for sentiment analysis that encodes representation from a transformer and applies deep intelligent contextual embedding to enhance the quality of tweets by removing noise while taking word sentiments, polysemy, syntax, and semantic knowledge into account. We also use the bidirectional long- and short-term memory network to determine the sentiment of a tweet. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, and results show that {DICET} considerably outperforms the state of the art in sentiment classification.},

	abstract = {Answering questions that require multi-hop reasoning at web-scale necessitates retrieving multiple evidence documents, one of which often has little lexical or semantic relationship to the question. This paper introduces a new graph-based recurrent retrieval approach that learns to retrieve reasoning paths over the Wikipedia graph to answer multi-hop open-domain questions. Our retriever model trains a recurrent neural network that learns to sequentially retrieve evidence paragraphs in the reasoning path by conditioning on the previously retrieved documents. Our reader model ranks the reasoning paths and extracts the answer span included in the best reasoning path. Experimental results show state-of-the-art results in three open-domain {QA} datasets, showcasing the effectiveness and robustness of our method. Notably, our method achieves significant improvement in {HotpotQA}, outperforming the previous best model by more than 14 points.},

Many people happily eat the same foods for breakfast day after day, yet seek more variety in the foods they eat for lunch and dinner. We identify psychological goals as a driver of this diurnal pattern of variety seeking, complementing other biological and cultural drivers. People are more likely to pursue hedonic goals for meals as the day progresses, which leads them to seek more variety for dinners and lunches than breakfasts. We find evidentiary support for our theory in studies with French and American participants (N = 4,481) using diary data, event reconstruction methods, and experiments. Both endogenously and exogenously induced variation in hedonic goal activation modulates variety seeking in meals across days. Hedonic goal activation predicts variety seeking for meals when controlling for factors including time devoted to meal preparation and eating, the presence or absence of other people, and whether people ate a meal inside or outside their home. Goal activation also explain differences in time spent on meals, whereas increasing time spent on meals does not increase variety seeking. Finally, we observed that a similar increase in hedonic goal activation enacts a larger increase in variety seeking at breakfast than at lunch than at dinner, suggesting a diminishing marginal effect of hedonic goal activation on variety seeking.},

A realistic assessment of the situation is necessary to utilize resources optimally and appropriately. In this research, we perform Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach. Identification of Covid-19 sentiments from tweets would allow informed decisions for better handling the current pandemic situation. The used dataset is extracted from Twitter using {IDs} as provided by the {IEEE} data port. Tweets are extracted by an in-house built crawler that uses the Tweepy library. The dataset is cleaned using the preprocessing techniques and sentiments are extracted using the {TextBlob} library. The contribution of this work is the performance evaluation of various machine learning classifiers using our proposed feature set. This set is formed by concatenating the bag-of-words and the term frequency-inverse document frequency. Tweets are classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Performance of classifiers is evaluated on the accuracy, precision, recall, and

              score. For completeness, further investigation is made on the dataset using the Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) architecture of the deep learning model. The results show that Extra Trees Classifiers outperform all other models by achieving a 0.93 accuracy score using our proposed concatenated features set. The {LSTM} achieves low accuracy as compared to machine learning classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed feature set, the results are compared with the Vader sentiment analysis technique based on the {GloVe} feature extraction approach.},

	abstract = {Lawyers regularly predict court outcomes to make strategic decisions, including when, if at all, to sue or settle, what to argue, and how to reduce their clients’ liability risk. Yet, lawyer predictions tend to be poorly calibrated and biased, which exacerbate unjustifiable disparities in civil case outcomes. Current machine learning ({ML}) approaches for predicting court outcomes are typically constrained to final dispositions or are based on features unavailable in real-time during litigation, like judicial opinions. Here, we present the first {ML}-based methods to support lawyer and client decision making in real-time for motion filings in civil proceedings. Using the State of Connecticut Judicial Branch administrative data and court case documents, we trained six classifiers to predict motion to strike outcomes in tort and vehicular cases between July 1, 2004 and February 18, 2019. Integrating dense word embeddings from complaint documents, which contain information specific to the claims alleged, with the Judicial Branch data improved classification accuracy across all models. Subsequent models defined using a novel attorney case-entropy feature, dense word embeddings using corpus specific {TF}-{IDF} weightings, and algorithmic classification rules yielded the best predictor, Adaboost, with a classification accuracy of 64.4\%. An analysis of feature importance weights confirmed the usefulness of incorporating attorney case-entropy and natural language features from complaint documents. Since all features used in model training are available during litigation, these methods will help lawyers make better predictions than they otherwise could given disparities in lawyer and client resources. All {ML} models, training code, and evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/aguiarlab/motionpredict.},

This research proposes a novel method to develop a knowledge-based recommender system from unstructured (text) data. The method is based on applying an opinion mining algorithm, extracting aspect-based sentiment score per text item, and transforming text into a structured form. An action rule mining algorithm is applied to the data table constructed from sentiment mining. The proposed application of the method is the problem of improving customer satisfaction ratings. The results obtained from the dataset of customer comments related to the repair services were evaluated with accuracy and coverage. Further, the results were incorporated into the framework of a web-based user-friendly recommender system to advise the business on how to maximally increase their proﬁts by introducing minimal sets of changes in their service.

While existing resources emphasize technical details of extracting web data, the authors propose a novel methodological framework focused on enhancing its validity. In particular, the framework highlights how addressing validity concerns requires the joint consideration of idiosyncratic technical and legal/ethical questions along the three stages of collecting web data: selecting data sources, designing the data collection, and extracting the data. The authors further review more than 300 articles using web data published in the top five marketing journals and offer a typology of how web data has advanced marketing thought. The article concludes with directions for future research to identify promising web data sources and to embrace novel approaches for using web data to capture and describe evolving marketplace realities.},

We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity—the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation—independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.},

With the credibility of online reviewers a frequent question, this research investigates how potential buyers assess the credibility of anonymous reviewers. Technology separates the reviewer from the review, and potential buyers are left to rely on characteristics of the review itself to determine the credibility of the reviewer. By extending the language expectancy theory to the online setting, we develop hypotheses about how expectancy violations of lexical complexity, twosidedness (highlighting positive and negative aspects of a product), and affect intensity influence credibility attributions. We present an experiment in which favorable experimental reviews were generated based on actual reviews for a digital camera. The results indicate that two-sidedness caused a positive expectancy violation resulting in greater credibility attribution. High affect intensity caused a negative expectancy violation resulting in lower credibility attribution. Finally, high reviewer credibility significantly improved perceptions of product quality. Our results demonstrate the importance of expectancies and violations when attributing credibility to anonymous individuals. Even small expectancy violations can meaningfully influence reviewer credibility and perceptions of products.},

	abstract = {Lawyers and judges spend a large amount of time researching the proper legal authority to cite while drafting decisions. In this paper, we develop a citation recommendation tool that can help improve efficiency in the process of opinion drafting. We train four types of machine learning models, including a citation-list based method (collaborative filtering) and three context-based methods (text similarity, {BiLSTM} and {RoBERTa} classifiers). Our experiments show that leveraging local textual context improves recommendation, and that deep neural models achieve decent performance. We show that non-deep text-based methods benefit from access to structured case metadata, but deep models only benefit from such access when predicting from context of insufficient length. We also find that, even after extensive training, {RoBERTa} does not outperform a recurrent neural model, despite its benefits of pretraining. Our behavior analysis of the {RoBERTa} model further shows that predictive performance is stable across time and citation classes.},

	abstract = {Purpose:  It has been over a year since the first known case of coronavirus disease ({COVID}-19) emerged, yet the pandemic is far from over. To date, the coronavirus pandemic has infected over eighty million people and has killed more than 1.78 million worldwide. This study aims to explore “how useful is Reddit social media platform to surveil {COVID}-19 pandemic?” and “how do people’s concerns/behaviors change over the course of {COVID}-19 pandemic in North Carolina?”. The purpose of this study was to compare people’s thoughts, behavior changes, discussion topics, and the number of confirmed cases and deaths by applying natural language processing ({NLP}) to {COVID}-19 related data.
Methods:  In this study, we collected {COVID}-19 related data from 18 subreddits of North Carolina from March to August 2020. Next, we applied methods from natural language processing and machine learning to analyze collected Reddit posts using feature engineering, topic modeling, custom named-entity recognition ({NER}), and {BERT}-based (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) sentence clustering. Using these methods, we were able to glean people’s responses and their concerns about {COVID}-19 pandemic in North Carolina.
Results:  We observed a positive change in attitudes towards masks for residents in North Carolina. The highfrequency words in all subreddit corpora for each of the {COVID}-19 mitigation strategy categories are: Distancing ({DIST})—“social distance/distancing”, “lockdown”, and “work from home”; Disinfection ({DIT})—“(hand) sanitizer/soap”, “hygiene”, and "wipe"; Personal Protective Equipment ({PPE})—“mask/facemask(s)/face shield”, “n95(s)/kn95”, and “cloth/ gown”; Symptoms ({SYM})—“death”, “flu/influenza”, and “cough/coughed”; Testing ({TEST})—“cases”, “(antibody) test”, and “test results (positive/negative)”.
Conclusion:  The findings in our study show that the use of Reddit data to monitor {COVID}-19 pandemic in North Carolina ({NC}) was effective. The study shows the utility of {NLP} methods (e.g. cosine similarity, Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}) topic modeling, custom {NER} and {BERT}-based sentence clustering) in discovering the change of the public’s concerns/behaviors over the course of {COVID}-19 pandemic in {NC} using Reddit data. Moreover, the results show that social media data can be utilized to surveil the epidemic situation in a specific community.},

We reflect upon and present the most pervasive and relevant sociocommunication function of an online presence on microposts and social networks: the phatic communication function. Although some theorists such as Malinowski say these microposts have no practical information value, we argue that they have semantic and social value for the interlocutors, determined by sociotechnological and cultural factors such as online presence and social awareness. We investigate and offer new implications for emerging social and communication dynamics formed around microposts, what we call here “phatic posts”. We suggest that apparently trivial uses and features of {SNS} actually play an important role in setting the social and informational context of the rest of the conversation - a “phatic” function - and thus that these phatic posts are key to the success of {SNS}.},

We propose a dictionary making procedure to avoid inclusion of words that are likely to confuse the model and deteriorate the its classification performance classification accuracy using a new entropy-based diagnostic tool. In our experiments, we classify sentences of the United Nations General Assembly speeches into six predefined categories using the seeded Latent Dirichlet allocation and Newsmap, which were trained with a small “seed word dictionary” that we created following the procedure. The result shows that, while keyword dictionary can only classify 25\% of sentences, Newsmap can classify over 60\% of them accurately correctly and; its accuracy exceeds 70\% when contextual information is taken into consideration by kernel smoothing of topic likelihoods. We argue that once seed word dictionaries are created by the international relations community, semisupervised models would become more useful than unsupervised models for theory-driven text analysis.},

In a content network, ideas connect to other ideas through their content—the words that the ideas have in common. We hypothesize that a high connectivity of an idea in a content network is beneﬁcial for idea diﬀusion because this idea will more likely be conceived as novel yet at the same time also as more useful because it appears as more familiar to the audience. Moreover, we posit that a high social connectivity of the team working on the idea further enhances the eﬀect of high content connectivity on idea diﬀusion.

Negative binomial analysis revealed that tweet features such as reaction time, number of followers, and usage of hashtag have an impact on tweet message diffusion during the tragedy.

            Depression is disabling and treatable, but underdiagnosed. In this study, we show that the content shared by consenting users on Facebook can predict a future occurrence of depression in their medical records. Language predictive of depression includes references to typical symptoms, including sadness, loneliness, hostility, rumination, and increased self-reference. This study suggests that an analysis of social media data could be used to screen consenting individuals for depression. Further, social media content may point clinicians to specific symptoms of depression.
          , 
            Depression, the most prevalent mental illness, is underdiagnosed and undertreated, highlighting the need to extend the scope of current screening methods. Here, we use language from Facebook posts of consenting individuals to predict depression recorded in electronic medical records. We accessed the history of Facebook statuses posted by 683 patients visiting a large urban academic emergency department, 114 of whom had a diagnosis of depression in their medical records. Using only the language preceding their first documentation of a diagnosis of depression, we could identify depressed patients with fair accuracy [area under the curve ({AUC}) = 0.69], approximately matching the accuracy of screening surveys benchmarked against medical records. Restricting Facebook data to only the 6 months immediately preceding the first documented diagnosis of depression yielded a higher prediction accuracy ({AUC} = 0.72) for those users who had sufficient Facebook data. Significant prediction of future depression status was possible as far as 3 months before its first documentation. We found that language predictors of depression include emotional (sadness), interpersonal (loneliness, hostility), and cognitive (preoccupation with the self, rumination) processes. Unobtrusive depression assessment through social media of consenting individuals may become feasible as a scalable complement to existing screening and monitoring procedures.},

As crisis situations are highly sensitive to the spread of rumors, Twitter posts from during the 2017 G20 summit are examined. Tweets regarding five rumors that were debunked during this event were manually coded into the following categories: rumor, debunking message, uncertainty about rumor, uncertainty about debunking message, and others. Our findings show that rumors which are debunked early and vehemently by official sources are the most likely to be stopped. When individuals participate in the process, they typically do so by sharing uncommented media content, as opposed to contributing user-generated content. Depending on the conditions in which a rumor arises, different network structures can be found. Since some rumors are easier for individuals to verify than others, our results have implications for the priorities of journalists and official sources.},

Lyrics encode an important part of the semantics of a song, therefore their analysis complements that of acoustic and cultural metadata and is fundamental for the development of complete music information retrieval systems. Moreover, a textual analysis of a song can generate ground truth data that can be used to validate results from purely acoustic methods. Preliminary results on language identiﬁcation, structure extraction, categorization and similarity searches suggests that a lot of proﬁt can be gained from the analysis of lyrics.},

While use of these systems to score key constructs in social and political psychology has many advantages, it is also dangerous if we do not fully evaluate the validity of these systems. In the present article, we evaluate a natural language processing system for one particular construct that has implications for solving key societal issues: Integrative complexity. We first review the growing body of evidence for the validity of the Automated Integrative Complexity ({AutoIC}) method for computer-scoring integrative complexity. We then provide five new validity tests: {AutoIC} successfully distinguished fourteen classic philosophic works from a large sample of both lay populations and political leaders (Test 1) and further distinguished classic philosophic works from the rhetoric of Donald Trump at higher rates than an alternative system (Test 2). Additionally, {AutoIC} successfully replicated key findings from the hand-scored {IC} literature on smoking cessation (Test 3), U.S. Presidents’ State of the Union Speeches (Test 4), and the ideology-complexity relationship (Test 5). Taken in total, this large body of evidence not only suggests that {AutoIC} is a valid system for scoring integrative complexity, but it also reveals important theory-building insights into key issues at the intersection of social and political psychology (health, leadership, and ideology). We close by discussing the broader contributions of the present validity tests to our understanding of issues vital to natural language processing.},

Using a combined strategy of time series analysis and domain adapted word embeddings, this study provides an in-depth analysis of several key moments during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. First, a time series outlier analysis is used to identify key moments during the debate. These moments had to result in a long-term shift in attention towards either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump (i.e., a transient change outlier or an intervention, resulting in a permanent change in the time series). To assess whether these moments also resulted in a discursive shift, two corpora are produced for each potential viral moment (a pre-viral corpus and post-viral corpus). A domain adaptation layer learns weights to combine a generic and domain speciﬁc ({DS}) word embedding into a domain adapted ({DA}) embedding. Words are then classiﬁed using a generic encoder+classiﬁer framework that relies on these word embeddings as inputs. Results suggest that both Clinton and Trump were able to induced discourse-shifting viral moments, though the former is much better at producing a topically-speciﬁc discursive shift.},

Our model extends earlier research by automatically identifying emphatic pitch accents, a subset of pitch accents that mark special discourse functions with extreme degrees of salience. The overall best performance achieved by our system was 87.8\% correct, 8.0\% above baseline performance. The results of a feature selection algorithm show that the top-performing features in our models are primarily acoustic measures. Our work identiﬁes important cues for emphasis in speech and shows that it is possible for an automated system to distinguish between two levels of perceived prominence in pitch accents with a high degree of accuracy.},

This research took a respondent perspective to examine if the {NPS} effectively captured the consumer’s sentiment.

Therein, a sentiment analysis approach was applied and the open-ended responses were coded based on the type and strength of the attitude.

	url = {https://osf.io/dpqj6},
	abstract = {Do we preferentially learn from outcomes that confirm our choices? This is one of the most basic, and yet consequence-bearing, questions concerning reinforcement learning. In recent years, we investigated this question in a series of studies implementing increasingly complex behavioral protocols. The learning rates fitted in experiments featuring partial or complete feedback, as well as free and forced choices, were systematically found to be consistent with a choice-confirmation bias. This result is robust across a broad range of outcome contingencies and response modalities. One of the prominent behavioral consequences of the confirmatory learning rate pattern is choice hysteresis: that is the tendency of repeating previous choices, despite contradictory evidence. As robust and replicable as they have proven to be, these findings were (legitimately) challenged by a couple of studies pointing out that a choice-confirmatory pattern of learning rates may spuriously arise from not taking into consideration an explicit choice autocorrelation term in the model. In the present study, we re-analyze data from four previously published papers (in total nine experiments; N=363), originally included in the studies demonstrating (or criticizing) the choice-confirmation bias in human participants. We fitted two models: one featured valence-specific updates (i.e., different learning rates for confirmatory and disconfirmatory outcomes) and one additionally including an explicit choice autocorrelation process (gradual perseveration). Our analysis confirms that the inclusion of the gradual perseveration process in the model significantly reduces the estimated choice-confirmation bias. However, in all considered experiments, the choice-confirmation bias remains present at the meta-analytical level, and significantly different from zero in most experiments. Our results demonstrate that the choice-confirmation bias resists the inclusion of an explicit choice autocorrelation term, thus proving to be a robust feature of human reinforcement learning.  We conclude by discussing the psychological plausibility of the gradual perseveration process in the context of these behavioral paradigms and by pointing to additional computational processes that may play an important role in estimating and interpreting the computational biases under scrutiny.},

	abstract = {Aspect-level sentiment classiﬁcation ({ASC}) is a research hotspot in natural language processing, which aims to infer the sentiment polarity of a particular aspect in an opinion sentence. There are three main inﬂuence factors in the aspect-level sentiment classiﬁcation: the semantic information of the context; the interaction information of the context and aspect; the position information between the aspect and the context. Some researchers have proposed way to solve aspect-level sentiment classiﬁcation. However, previous work mainly used the average vector of the aspect to calculate the attention score of the context, which introduced the inﬂuence of noise words. Moreover, these attention-based approaches simply used relative positions to calculate positional information for contextual and aspect terms and did not provided better semantic information. Based on these above questions, in this paper, we propose the {PSRTN} model. Firstly, obtaining the position-aware inﬂuence propagate between words and aspects by Gaussian kernel and generating the inﬂuence vector for each context word. Secondly, capturing global and local information of the context by the R-Transformer, and using the self-attention mechanism to obtain the keywords in the aspect. Finally, context representation of a particular aspect is generated for classiﬁcation. In order to evaluate the validity of the model, we conduct experiments on {SemEval}2014 and Twitter. The results show that the accuracy of the {PSRTN} model can reach 83.8\%, 80.9\%, and 75.1\% on three data sets, respectively.},

They customize a neural network language model to derive latent product attributes by analyzing the co-occurrences of products in shopping baskets. Applying dimensionality reduction to the latent attributes yields a two-dimensional product map. This method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that are readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The approach has high usability because it is automated, is scalable and does not require a priori assumptions. Its results are easy to interpret and update as new market basket data are collected. The authors validate their approach both by conducting an extensive simulation study and by comparing their results with those of state-of-the-art, econometric methods for modeling product relationships. The application of this approach using data collected at a leading German grocery retailer underlines its usefulness and provides novel findings that are relevant to assortment-related decisions.},

They classify psychological themes on the basis of the “character strengths” taxonomy from the positive psychology literature (Peterson and Seligman 2004). They develop a natural language processing tool, guided latent Dirichlet allocation ({LDA}), that automatically extracts a set of features of entertainment products from their descriptions. Guided {LDA} is flexible enough to allow features to be informed by psychological themes while allowing other relevant dimensions to emerge. The authors apply this tool to movies and show that guided {LDA} features help better predict movie-watching behavior at the individual level. They find this result with both award-winning movies and blockbuster movies. They illustrate the potential of the proposed approach in pure content-based predictive models of consumer behavior, as well as in hybrid predictive models that combine content-based models with collaborative filtering. They also show that guided {LDA} can improve the performance of models that predict aggregate outcomes.},

The central thesis is that when retellers believe they are more (vs. less) knowledgeable than their recipient about the information they are relaying, they feel more compelled to provide guidance on its meaning and to do so in a persuasive manner. This enhanced motivation to guide persuasively, in turn, leads retellers to not only select the subset of facts they deem most essential but, critically, to provide their interpretations and opinions on those facts, with negativity being used as a means of grabbing their audience’s attention.

Incentivized (vs. unincentivized) reviews contained a greater proportion of positive relative to negative emotion across a variety of product and service experiences (e.g., videos, service providers, consumer packaged goods companies). This effect occurred for both financial and nonfinancial incentives and when assessing review content across multiple natural language processing tools and human judgments. Incentives influence review content by modifying the experience of writing reviews. That is, when incentives are associated with review writing, they cause the positive affect that results from receiving an incentive to transfer to the review-writing experience, making review writing more enjoyable. In line with this process, the effect of an incentive on review positivity attenuates when incentives are weakly (vs. strongly) associated with review writing (i.e., incentive for “participating in an experiment” vs. “writing a review”) and when the incentive does not transfer positive affect (i.e., when an incentive is provided by a disliked company). By examining when incentives do (vs. do not) adjust the relative positivity of written reviews, this research offers theoretical insight into the literature on incentives, motivation, and word of mouth, with practical implications for managers.},

The authors overcome this challenge by applying deep learning–based natural language processing on data that tracks individual-level review reading, searching, and purchasing behaviors on an e-commerce site to investigate how consumers use review content. They extract quality and price content from 500,000 reviews of 600 product categories and achieve two objectives. First, the authors describe consumers’ review-content-reading behaviors. Although consumers do not read review content all the time, they do rely on it for products that are expensive or of uncertain quality. Second, the authors quantify the causal impact of read-review content on sales by using supervised deep learning to tag six theory-driven content dimensions and applying a regression discontinuity in time design. They find that aesthetics and price content significantly increase conversion across almost all product categories. Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6\% price cut for boosting conversion.},

This focus on gist, in turn, tends to manifest as reviews that emphasize the emotional aspects of an experience in lieu of more specific details. Across five studies—two field studies and three controlled experiments—the authors use natural language processing tools and human assessments to analyze the linguistic characteristics of user-generated content. The findings support the thesis that smartphone use results in the creation of content that is less specific and privileges affect—especially positive affect—relative to {PC}-generated content.

              While the motivation for collecting art has received considerable attention in the literature, less is known about the characteristics of the typical art collector. This paper aims to explore these characteristics to develop a typology of art consumers using a mixed method approach over several studies.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This is achieved by analyzing qualitative data, gathered via semi-structured interviews of art collectors, and quantitatively by means of natural language processing analysis and automated text analysis and using correspondence analysis to analyze and present the results.
            
            
              Findings
              The study’s findings reveal four distinct clusters of art collectors based on their “Big Five” personality traits, as well as uncovering insights into how these types talk about their possessions.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of consumers that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions in other markets. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating the “doubling” procedure to deal with percentile data.
            
            
              Practical implications
              In addition to contributing to the arts marketing literature, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of art collectors that managers can use for market segmentation and target marketing decisions. The paper also offers a methodological contribution to the literature on correspondence analysis by demonstrating a non-traditional application of correspondence analysis using the “doubling” procedure. Buyer behavior in the fine art market is not exhaustively studied. By understanding the personality traits of consumers in the art market, sales forces can better provide assistance and product to consumers. Further, understanding the personalities of consumers is better for art retail spaces to better serve consumers.

            This work describes and illustrates a free and easy-to-use online text-analysis tool for understanding how consumer word use varies across contexts. The tool, Wordify, uses randomized logistic regression ({RLR}) to identify the words that best discriminate texts drawn from different pre-classified corpora, such as posts written by men versus women, or texts containing mostly negative versus positive valence. We present illustrative examples to show how the tool can be used for such diverse purposes as (1) uncovering the distinctive vocabularies that consumers use when writing reviews on smartphones versus {PCs}, (2) discovering how the words used in Tweets differ between presumed supporters and opponents of a controversial ad, and (3) expanding the dictionaries of dictionary-based sentiment-measurement tools. We show empirically that Wordify’s {RLR} algorithm performs better at discriminating vocabularies than support vector machines and chi-square selectors, while offering significant advantages in computing time. A discussion is also provided on the use of Wordify in conjunction with other text-analysis tools, such as probabilistic topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to gain more profound knowledge of the role of language in consumer behavior.},

              The purpose of this study is twofold: first to demonstrate the application of an algorithm using contextual data to ascertain consumer personality traits; and second to explore the factors impacting the relationship between personality traits and advertisement persuasiveness.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              A mixed-method approach that comprises two distinct yet complementary studies. The first uses quantitative methods and is based on a sample of 35,264 retail banking customers. Study 2 explores the findings that emerge from Study 1 using qualitative methods.
            
            
              Findings
              This paper finds that matching consumer personality with congruent advertising messages can lead to more effective consumer persuasion for most personality types. For consumers who exhibit neurotic personality traits, ameliorating perceived risks during purchasing and providing cues for social acceptance and goal attainment are important factors for advertising effectiveness. These factors also had a positive impact on the purchasing behaviour of extroverted consumers.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              This research focusses on understanding purchasing behaviour based on the most dominant personality trait. However, people are likely to exhibit a combination of most or even all of the Big Five personality traits.
            
            
              Practical implications
              Building on advances in natural language processing, enabling the identification of personality from language, this study demonstrates the possibility of influencing consumer behaviour by matching machine inferred personality to congruent persuasive advertising. It is one of the few studies to use contextual instead of social media data to capture individual personality. Such data serves to capture an authentic rather than contrived persona. Further, the study identifies the factors that may moderate this relationship and thereby provides an explanation of why some personality traits exhibit differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are anticipated by existing theory.

              Although the idea that people are more likely to be responsive to advertising messages that are congruent with their personality type has already been successfully applied by advertising practitioners and documented by advertising scholars, this study extends existing research by identifying the factors that may moderate this relationship and thereby provides an explanation why some personality traits may exhibit differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are anticipated by existing theory.},

	abstract = {Sales, product design, and engineering teams benefit immensely from better understanding customer perspectives. How do customers combine a product's technical specifications (i.e., engineered attributes) to form abstract product benefits (i.e., meta-attributes)? To address this question, the authors use machine learning and natural language processing to develop a methodological framework that extracts a hierarchy of product attributes based on contextual information of how attributes are expressed in consumer reviews. The attribute hierarchy reveals linkages between engineered attributes and meta-attributes within a product category, enabling flexible sentiment analysis that can identify how consumers receive meta-attributes, and which engineered attributes are main drivers. The framework can guide managers to monitor only portions of review content that are relevant to specific attributes of interest. Moreover, managers can compare products within and between brands, where different names and attribute combinations are often associated with similar benefits. The authors apply the framework to the tablet computer category to generate dashboards and perceptual maps and provide validations of the attribute hierarchy using both primary and secondary data. Resultant insights allow the exploration of substantive questions, such as how Apple improved successive generations of {iPads} and why Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba discontinued their tablet product lines.},

          , 
            In recent years, there has been significant interest in understanding users’ online content consumption patterns. But the unstructured, high-dimensional, and dynamic nature of such data makes extracting valuable insights challenging. Here we propose a model that combines the simplicity of matrix factorization with the flexibility of neural networks to efficiently extract nonlinear patterns from massive text data collections relevant to consumers’ online consumption patterns. Our model decomposes a user’s content consumption journey into nonlinear user and content factors that are used to model their dynamic interests. This natural decomposition allows us to summarize each user’s content consumption journey with a dynamic probabilistic weighting over a set of underlying content attributes. The model is fast to estimate, easy to interpret, and can harness external data sources as an empirical prior. These advantages make our method well suited to the challenges posed by modern data sets used by digital marketers. We use our model to understand the dynamic news consumption interests of Boston Globe readers over five years. Thorough qualitative studies, including a crowdsourced evaluation, highlight our model’s ability to accurately identify nuanced and coherent consumption patterns. These results are supported by our model’s superior and robust predictive performance over several competitive baseline methods.},

	abstract = {We evaluate user-generated content as a source of customer needs and propose and test a machine-learning approach for identifying customer needs more efficiently.
          , 
            Firms traditionally rely on interviews and focus groups to identify customer needs for marketing strategy and product development. User-generated content ({UGC}) is a promising alternative source for identifying customer needs. However, established methods are neither efficient nor effective for large {UGC} corpora because much content is noninformative or repetitive. We propose a machine-learning approach to facilitate qualitative analysis by selecting content for efficient review. We use a convolutional neural network to filter out noninformative content and cluster dense sentence embeddings to avoid sampling repetitive content. We further address two key questions: Are {UGC}-based customer needs comparable to interview-based customer needs? Do the machine-learning methods improve customer-need identification? These comparisons are enabled by a custom data set of customer needs for oral care products identified by professional analysts using industry-standard experiential interviews. The analysts also coded 12,000 {UGC} sentences to identify which previously identified customer needs and/or new customer needs were articulated in each sentence. We show that (1) {UGC} is at least as valuable as a source of customer needs for product development, likely more valuable, compared with conventional methods, and (2) machine-learning methods improve efficiency of identifying customer needs from {UGC} (unique customer needs per unit of professional services cost).

Our objective is to convert the user-generated content to market structures and competitive landscape insights. The difficulty in obtaining such market-structure insights from online user-generated content is that consumers' postings are often not easy to syndicate. To address these issues, we employ a text-mining approach and combine it with semantic network analysis tools. We demonstrate this approach using two cases—sedan cars and diabetes drugs—generating market-structure perceptual maps and meaningful insights without interviewing a single consumer. We compare a market structure based on user-generated content data with a market structure derived from more traditional sales and survey-based data to establish validity and highlight meaningful differences.},

Dimensions induced by word differences ( rich – poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is education, which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its association with cultivated taste.},

Dr. Oz, a celebrity physician, often makes medical recommendations with limited or marginal scientific evidence. Although reputable news agencies have traditionally acted as gatekeepers of reliable information, they face the intense pressure of “the eyeball game.” Customer reviews, despite their authenticity, may come from deceived consumers. Therefore, it remains unclear whether public information sources can correct the misleading health information. In the context of over-the-counter weight loss products, the authors carefully analyze the cascading of information post endorsement. The analysis of extensive textual content with deep-learning methods reveals that legitimate news outlets respond to Dr. Oz's endorsement by generating more news articles about the ingredient; on average, articles after the endorsement contain higher sentiment, so news agencies seem to amplify rather than rectify the misleading endorsement. The finding highlights a serious concern: the risk of hype news diffusion. Research articles react too slowly to mitigate the problem, and online customer reviews and product discussions provide only marginal corrections. The findings underscore the importance of oversight to mitigate the risk of cascading hype news.},

This tendency is found in a wide range of domains including social media posts, online restaurant reviews, open-ended survey responses, and compliance with requests for personal information in web advertisements. The authors show that this increased willingness to self-disclose on one’s smartphone arises from the psychological effects of two distinguishing properties of the device: (1) feelings of comfort that many associate with their smartphone and (2) a tendency to narrowly focus attention on the disclosure task at hand due to the relative difficulty of generating content on the smaller device. The enhancing effect of smartphones on self-disclosure yields several important marketing implications, including the creation of content that is perceived as more persuasive by outside readers. The authors explore implications for how these findings can be strategically leveraged by managers, including how they may generalize to other emerging technologies.},

The authors address this problem by developing hypotheses that relate the number of B2B-{SIs} and B2C-{SIs} to firm value and firm risk together with the moderators (the number of product innovations and customer-focus innovations). To test the hypotheses, the authors develop and estimate a model using unique panel data of 2,263 {SIs} across 15 industries over eight years assembled from multiple data sources and controlling for firm- and market-specific factors, heterogeneity, and endogeneity. They analyze innovation announcements using natural language processing. The results show that B2B-{SIs} have a positive effect on firm value and an insignificant influence on firm risk. Importantly, the effect of a B2B-{SI} on firm value is significantly greater than that of a B2C-{SI}. Unlike B2C-{SIs}, the effect of B2B-{SIs} on firm value is greater when the firm has more product innovations. Surprisingly, unlike B2C-{SIs}, the effect of B2B-{SIs} on firm value is less positive when the {SIs} emphasize customers. These findings offer important insights about the relative value of B2B-{SIs}.},

            Voice-based interfaces provide new opportunities for firms to interact with consumers along the customer journey. The current work demonstrates across four studies that voice-based (as opposed to text-based) interfaces promote more flow-like user experiences, resulting in more positively-valenced service experiences, and ultimately more favorable behavioral firm outcomes (i.e., contract renewal, conversion rates, and consumer sentiment). Moreover, we also provide evidence for two important boundary conditions that reduce such flow-like user experiences in voice-based interfaces (i.e., semantic disfluency and the amount of conversational turns). The findings of this research highlight how fundamental theories of human communication can be harnessed to create more experiential service experiences with positive downstream consequences for consumers and firms. These findings have important practical implications for firms that aim at leveraging the potential of voice-based interfaces to improve consumers’ service experiences and the theory-driven “conversational design” of voice-based interfaces.},

            This article explores the idea that consumer influencers can shape reference group meanings in social media. Through a survey in which over 5,000 participants provided open-ended reference group associations for 25 major brands, the authors find that social media influencers can either strengthen or change brand reference group associations. Specifically, the typicality of the influencer (relative to a brand’s stereotypical consumer) can shape ideas about the perceived homogeneity of the brand’s consumers, which ultimately influences the strength and tightness of brand associations. This research combines seminal theories regarding cultural and sociological influences on branding, concepts relating to stereotype change, and a multi-method approach to assess new digital flows of cultural meaning from consumer influencers to brands.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Some cultural products (e.g., books and movies) catch on and become popular, while others fail. Why? While some have argued that success is unpredictable, we suggest that period-to-period shifts in sentiment—what we term sentiment volatility—enhance engagement. Automated sentiment analysis of over 4,000 movies demonstrates that more volatile movies are evaluated more positively. Consistent with the notion that sentiment volatility makes experiences more stimulating, the effect is stronger in genres where evaluations are more likely to be driven stimulation (i.e., thrillers rather than romance). Further, analysis of over 30,000 online articles demonstrate that people are more likely to continue reading more volatile articles. By manipulating sentiment volatility in follow-up experiments, we underscore its causal impact on evaluations, and provide evidence for the role of stimulation in these effects. Taken together, the results shed light on what drives engagement, the time dynamics of sentiment, and cultural analytics or why some cultural items are more successful.},

The index assesses topical relevance drawing on a dictionary of marketing terms derived from 50,000 marketing articles published in practitioner outlets from 1982 to 2019. Timely relevance is based on the prevalence of academic marketing topics in practitioner publications at a given time. The authors classify topics into four quadrants based on their low/high popularity in academia and practice —“Desert,” “Academic Island,” “Executive Fields,” and “Highlands”—and score academic articles and journals: Journal of Marketing has the highest R2M score, followed by Marketing Science, Journal of Marketing Research, and Journal of Consumer Research. The index correlates with practitioner judgments of practical relevance and other relevance measures. Because the index is a work in progress, the authors discuss how to overcome current limitations and suggest correlating the index with citation counts, altmetrics, and readability measures. Marketing practitioners, authors, and journal editors can use the index to assess article relevance, and academic administrators can use it for promotion and tenure decisions (see www.R2Mindex.com). The R2M Index is thus not only a measurement instrument but also a tool for change.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to provide a state-of-the-art review of research on consumers experiencing vulnerability to describe the current situation of the consumers experiencing vulnerability literature and develop an up-to-date synthesised definition of consumers experiencing vulnerability.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This systematic review, guided by the {PRISMA} framework, takes a multi-disciplinary approach to identify 310 articles published between 2010 and 2019 examining consumers experiencing vulnerability. Descriptive analysis of the data is undertaken in combination with a thematic and text mining approach using Leximancer software.
            
            
              Findings
              A definition of consumers experiencing vulnerability is developed- “unique and subjective experiences where characteristics such as states, conditions and/or external factors lead to a consumer experiencing a sense of powerlessness in consumption settings”. The findings reveal consumers experiencing vulnerability have often been classified using a uni-dimensional approach (opposed to a multi-dimensional), focussing on one factor of vulnerability, the most prevalent of these being economic and age factors. A lack of research has examined consumers experiencing vulnerability based upon geographical remoteness, gender and sexual exploitation.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper is one of the first to examine consumers experiencing vulnerability using a systematic approach and text mining analysis to synthesise a large set of articles, which subsequently reduces the potential for researchers’ interpretative bias. Further, it is the first to generate a data-driven definition of consumers experiencing vulnerability. It provides targeted recommendations to allow further scholarly, policy and practical contributions to this area.},

This research presents a new approach for harvesting rich, qualitative information on brands from user-generated social tags. The authors first compare their proposed approach with conventional techniques such as brand concept maps and text mining. They highlight the added value of their approach that results from the unconstrained, open-ended, and synoptic nature of consumer-generated content contained within social tags. The authors then apply existing text-mining and data-reduction methods to analyze disaggregate-level social tagging data for marketing research and demonstrate how marketers can utilize the information in social tags by extracting key representative topics, monitoring common dynamic trends, and understanding heterogeneous perceptions of a brand.},

New insights into the customer review phenomenon can be derived from studying the semantic content and style properties of verbatim customer reviews to examine their influence on online retail sites' conversion rates. The authors employ text mining to extract changes in affective content and linguistic style properties of customer book reviews on Amazon.com . A dynamic panel data model reveals that the influence of positive affective content on conversion rates is asymmetrical, such that greater increases in positive affective content in customer reviews have a smaller effect on subsequent increases in conversion rate. No such tapering-off effect occurs for changes in negative affective content in reviews. Furthermore, positive changes in affective cues and increasing congruence with the product interest group's typical linguistic style directly and conjointly increase conversion rates. These findings suggest that managers should identify and promote the most influential reviews in a given product category, provide instructions to stimulate reviewers to write powerful reviews, and adapt the style of their own editorial reviews to the relevant product category.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the concepts and theories underlying customer service experience ({CSE}) and its underlying five dimensions (physical, social, cognitive, affective and sensorial). In this research, the contribution of the sensorial dimension to {CSE} research is emphasized. Senses are especially important in forming perceptions within servicescapes that are typically rich in sensory stimuli.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study systematically identifies 258 articles published between 1994 and 2018 in services and marketing journals. The analysis uses a text mining approach with the Leximancer software to extract research concepts and their relationships.
            
            
              Findings
              The results demonstrate a shift from {CSE} research focused on brands and products toward value and interaction, around three focal areas: service system architecture, with its value creation processes; servicescape, with an increasingly digital interaction interface and outcome measures, with a stronger focus on emotional and relational metrics. In {CSE} research, the physical, social and cognitive dimensions are mostly researched in the focal areas of servicescape and outcome measures. Although important in practice, the sensorial dimension is the least investigated {CSE} dimension in service marketing research. Text mining insights demonstrate rich opportunities for sensorial research, particularly in studies on servicescape.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The synthesis will inform managers and service providers which elements of {CSE} are most relevant to customers when forming perceptions. These insights help service providers to control, manage and design (multi)-sensory stimuli that influence how customers will make sense of the servicescape.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This research is one of the first studies to examine the conceptual structure of {CSE} with a text mining approach that systematically analyzes a large set of articles, therein reducing the potential for researchers’ interpretative bias. The paper provides an assessment of the role of the largely neglected but crucial sensorial dimension, and offers future research suggestions into this emerging topic.},

In this article, the authors present a method to support the analysis and visualization of market structure by automatically eliciting product attributes and brand's relative positions from online customer reviews. First, the method uncovers attributes and attribute dimensions using the “voice of the consumer,” as reflected in customer reviews, rather than that of manufacturers. Second, the approach runs automatically. Third, the process supports rather than supplants managerial judgment by reinforcing or augmenting attributes and dimensions found through traditional surveys and focus groups. The authors test the approach on six years of customer reviews for digital cameras during a period of rapid market evolution. They analyze and visualize results in several ways, including comparisons with expert buying guides, a laboratory survey, and correspondence analysis of automatically discovered product attributes. The authors evaluate managerial insights drawn from the analysis with respect to proprietary market research reports from the same period analyzing digital imaging products.},

Using a combination of real data and simulations, we demonstrate that a sampling procedure that selects respondents whose comments contain a large amount of information is superior to the two most popular sampling methods—simple random sampling and stratified random sampling—-in gaining insights from the data. In addition, we derive a method that determines the probability of observing diagnostic information repeated a specific number of times in the population, which will enable managers to base sample size decisions on the trade-off between obtaining additional diagnostic information and the added expense of a larger sample. We provide an illustration of one of the methods using a real data set from a website containing qualitative comments about staying at a hotel and demonstrate how sampling qualitative comments can be a useful first step in text mining.},

            This research sheds light on consumer motivations for participating in the sharing economy and examines downstream consequences of the uncovered motivations. We use text-mining techniques to extract Airbnb hosts’ motivations from their responses to the question “why did you start hosting.” We find that hosts are driven not only by the monetary motivation “to earn cash” but also by intrinsic motivations such as “to share beauty” and “to meet people.” Using extensive transaction-level data, we find that hosts with intrinsic motivations post more property photos and write longer property descriptions, demonstrating greater engagement with the platform. Consequently, these hosts receive higher guest satisfaction ratings. Compared to hosts who want to earn cash, hosts motivated to meet people are more likely to keep hosting and to stay active on the platform, and hosts motivated to share beauty charge higher prices. As a result, these intrinsically motivated hosts have a higher customer lifetime value compared to those with a monetary motivation. We employ a multimethod approach including text mining, Bayesian latent attrition models, and lab experiments to derive these insights. Our research provides an easy-to-implement approach to uncovering consumer motivations in practice and highlights the consequential role of these motivations for firms.},

	abstract = {This article highlights how social media data and language analysis can help managers understand brand positioning and brand competitive spaces to enable them to make various strategic and tactical decisions about brands. The authors use the output of topic models at the brand level to evaluate similarities between brands and to identify potential cobrand partners. In addition to using average topic probabilities to assess brands’ relationships to each other, they incorporate a differential language analysis framework, which implements scientific inference with multi-test-corrected hypothesis testing, to evaluate positive and negative topic correlates of brand names. The authors highlight the various applications of these approaches in decision making for brand management, including the assessment of brand positioning and future cobranding partnerships, design of marketing communication, identification of new product introductions, and identification of potential negative brand associations that can pose a threat to a brand's image. Moreover, they introduce a new metric, “temporal topic variability,” that can serve as an early warning of future changes in consumer preference. The authors evaluate social media analytic contributions against offline survey data. They demonstrate their approach with a sample of 193 brands, representing a broad set of categories, and discuss its implications.},

	abstract = {During the past two decades, the focus of marketing has moved from the tactics of persuasion to the strategies of value cocreation. After moving toward cognitive science and corporate strategies in the early 2000s, marketing research returned to its traditional domains of consumer psychologies and customer management. While conscientious consumers are gradually restraining themselves from selfish indulgence, marketers have refocused on a new set of values that encompass mental, experiential, and societal well-being. In this regard, we adopt an unprecedented approach by incorporating topic modeling with social network analysis. The results show that, in terms of topic heterogeneity, the most impactful journals are the most diverse, whereas each runner-up has a unique focus. Among the journals, we detect two major co-authorship communities, and among the topics, we detect three. Further, we find that the communities of the most cited papers are composed of heterogeneous clusters of similar topics. The pivots within, and the bridges between, these communities are also reported. In the spirit of collaborative research, our topic model and network analysis are shared via online collaboration and visualization platforms that readers can use to explore our models interactively and to download the dataset for further studies.},

	abstract = {Online social networks, as popular media and communications tools with their own extensive uses, play key roles in public opinion polls, politics, economy, and even governance. An important issue regarding these networks is the use of multiple sources of publishing or re-publishing news and propositions that can influence audiences depending on the level of trust in these sources between users. Therefore, estimating the level of trust in social networks between users can predict the extent of social networks’ impact on news and different publication and re-publication sources, and correspondingly provide effective strategies in news dissemination, advertisements, and other diverse contents for trustees. Therefore, trust is introduced and interpreted in the present study. A large portion of interactions in social networks is based on sending and receiving texts employing natural language processing techniques. A Hidden Markov Model ({HMM}) was designed via an efficient model, namely {SenseTrust}, to estimate the level of trust between users in social networks.},

Some of the most usual mindset metrics are brand awareness, brand image, personality traits, and attribute importance. Brand awareness and other mindset measures have the form of texts (bag of words). And, a natural methodology for analyzing these variables is topic modeling and the popular Latent Dirichlet allocation ({LDA}) model. The {LDA} methodology assumes that brands or concepts are represented by clusters of brands in consumers’ minds. This study proposes an extension/modification of the {LDA} model for brand awareness and other mindset variables that incorporate Bernoulli observations instead of the Multinomial specification present in the usual {LDA} specification. This extension is relevant since, unlike words in texts, brands and mindset concepts are not repeated within a document and have a dichotomous form, present or absent. The proposed model is applied to two brand awareness datasets. The results show significant gains in both managerial insights in analyzing brand clusters and consumers’ profiles.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This study aims to examine how characteristics of an online review and a consumer reading the review influence the probability that the consumer will assess the review as authentic (real) or inauthentic (fake). This study further examines the specific factors that increase or decrease a consumer’s ability to detect a review’s authenticity and reasons a consumer makes these authenticity assessments.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Hypothesized relationships were tested using an online experiment of over 400 respondents who collectively provided 3,224 authenticity assessments along with 3,181 written self-report reasons for assessing a review as authentic or inauthentic.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings indicate that specific combinations of factors including review valence, length, readability, type of content and consumer personality traits and demographics lead to systematic bias in assessing review authenticity. Using qualitative analysis, this paper provided further insight into why consumers are deceived.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              This research showed there are important differences in the way the authenticity assessment process works for positive versus negative reviews and identified factors that can make a fake review hard to spot or a real review hard to believe.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This research has implications for both consumers and businesses by emphasizing areas of vulnerability for fake information and providing guidance for how to design review systems for improved veracity.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This research is one of the few works that explicates how people assess information authenticity and their consequent assessment accuracy in the context of online reviews.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Under the influence of the health emergency triggered by the {COVID}-19 pandemic, many brands changed their communication strategy and included more or less explicit references to the principles of solidarity and fraternity in their {TV} commercials to boost the confidence and hope of Italian families during the lockdown. The traditional attitudes of the advertising format, which focused on product characteristics, were relegated to the background in order to reinforce the “brand image” through words, signs, hashtags and music that spread empathetic messages to all those who needed to regain hope and trust in a time of extreme emotional fragility. The objective of this paper is to identify the emotions and brand awareness during the lockdown using text mining techniques by measuring customer sentiment expressed on the Twitter social network. Our proposal starts from an unstructured corpus of 20,982 tweets processed with text data mining techniques to identify patterns and trends in people’s posts related to specific hashtags and {TV} ads produced during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. The innovations in the brand’s advertising among consumers seem to have triggered some sense of appreciation and gratitude, as well as a strong sense of belonging that was not present before, as the {TV} ads were perceived as a disruptive element in consumers’ tweets. Although this effect is clearly documented, in this paper we demonstrate its transitory nature, in the sense that the frequency of occurrence of terms associated with an emotional dimension peaks during the weeks of lockdown, and then gradually decreases.},

Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words as relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional space, specifying a relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary theories of culture. Dimensions induced by word differences ( rich – poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is education, which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its association with cultivated taste.},

	abstract = {Understanding how words change their meanings over time is key to models of language and cultural evolution, but historical data on meaning is scarce, making theories hard to develop and test. Word embeddings show promise as a diachronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robust methodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings ({PPMI}, {SVD}, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity---the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation---independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.},

            This paper studies the use of emotion and reason in political discourse. Adopting computational-linguistics techniques to construct a validated text-based scale, we measure emotionality in six million speeches given in U.S. Congress over the years 1858–2014. Intuitively, emotionality spikes during times of war and is highest in speeches about patriotism. In the time series, emotionality was relatively low and stable in earlier years but increased significantly starting in the late 1970s. Across Congress members, emotionality is higher for Democrats, for women, for ethnic/religious minorities, for the opposition party and for members with ideologically extreme roll-call voting records.},

Many firms are also multihoming, using competing platforms concurrently. In this study, we examine how selling and buying activities on B2B exchanges affect multihoming buyers’ preferences for exchanges. We posit that these activities influence buyers’ perceived returns and risks of using the exchanges, and impact buyers’ preferences. Using a unique dataset of 118 buyers’ participation in two B2B exchanges over seven months, we find that buyers prefer exchanges with more selling activities. However, buyers’ preferences and buying levels on the exchanges are non-monotonically related. At low buying levels, an increase in buying by others positively affects buyers’ preferences. This effect may result from observational learning, where individual buyers learn from other buyers’ behaviors. On the other hand, as buying level increases further on the exchange, competition among buyers also increases. Consequently, buyers lower their preferences for the exchange. In addition, we find that the effects of selling and buying activities on buyers’ preferences change over time. Our results highlight the need to correctly model buyers’ homing behavior; failing to do so could bias the picture of competitive dynamics between platforms and lead to suboptimal strategies by exchanges.},

This study explicates the multilateral interdependence among different groups of producers within a platform ecosystem. We theorize about how platform owners’ governance design may create frictions between platform providers and complementors. While open governance grants greater autonomy to platform providers, it also cultivates a more complex ecosystem for complementors. Since ecosystem complexity raises the cost of product customization, complementors will be less willing to port an existing complement to a more complex ecosystem, that is, less likely to multihome. The negative effect is weakened as the complementor has greater experience with the destination ecosystem or when the complement exhibits a greater level of modularity. Our analysis of newly launched apps in Apple’s {iOS} and Google’s Android smartphone ecosystems finds supportive evidence. We discuss implications for the burgeoning literature on platform ecosystems and complementors.},

            Technological learning encompasses a variety of mechanisms by which technologies improve and decrease in costs. Experience curves are commonly used to analyze and explicitly quantify technological learning. This chapter presents the history and basic methodology of experience curves, and discusses the implementation of experience curves in energy system and sectoral energy models. Several key results of the {REFLEX} project with respect to state-of-the-art experience curves, and the implementation of experience curves in the {REFLEX} Energy Modeling System are highlighted. Finally, a set of key lessons learned in the {REFLEX} project are presented, discussing both methodological issues of experience curves as well as key issues with regard to the implementation of experience curves in different types of energy system and sectoral energy models.},

It was especially gratifying for me to learn that {INFORMS} members have voted the “Bass Model” paper as one of the Top 10 Most Influential Papers published in the 50-year history of Management Science in connection with the 50th anniversary of the journal. In this commentary on the paper I shall discuss some background and history of the development of the paper, the reasons why the model has been influential, some important extensions of the model, some examples of applications, and some examples of the frontiers of research involving the Bass Model. In the current period, in which there is much discussion about the marketing of applications of management science methods and practice, I hope that this commentary will be useful in providing insights about some of the properties of models that will be applied.},

We develop a model to link explicitly the antecedents and consequences of satisfaction in a utility-oriented framework. We estimate and test the model against alternative hypotheses from the satisfaction literature. In the process, a unique database is analyzed: a nationally representative survey of 22,300 customers of a variety of major products and services in Sweden in 1989–1990. Several well-known experimental findings of satisfaction research are tested in a field setting of national scope. For example, we find that satisfaction is best specified as a function of perceived quality and “disconfirmation”—the extent to which perceived quality fails to match prepurchase expectations. Surprisingly, expectations do not directly affect satisfaction, as is often suggested in the satisfaction literature. In addition, we find quality which falls short of expectations has a greater impact on satisfaction and repurchase intentions than quality which exceeds expectations. Moreover, we find that disconfirmation is more likely to occur when quality is easy to evaluate. Finally, in terms of systematic variation across firms, we find the elasticity of repurchase intentions with respect to satisfaction to be lower for firms that provide high satisfaction. This implies a long-run reputation effect insulating firms which consistently provide high satisfaction.},

Using justice theory, the authors also demonstrate that customers evaluate complaint incidents in terms of the outcomes they receive, the procedures used to arrive at the outcomes, and the nature of the interpersonal treatment during the process. In turn, the authors develop and test competing hypotheses regarding the interplay between satisfaction with complaint handling and prior experience in shaping customer trust and commitment. The results support a quasi “brand equity” perspective—whereas satisfaction with complaint handling has a direct impact on trust and commitment, prior positive experiences mitigate, to a limited extent, the effects of poor complaint handling.

The authors develop a customer base model to investigate the effectiveness of recovery in preventing customer churn. They calibrate it on panel data that track actual purchases, complaints, and recoveries for 20,000 new customers of an Internet and catalog retailer over 2.5 years. Complaints are associated with a substantial increase in the probability that the customer stops buying, but the size of the increase depends on prior customer experiences: prior purchases mitigate the effect, and their impact is long-lasting, whereas prior complaints exacerbate the effect, but their impact is short-lived. Thus, unless the customer leaves the company after a complaint, or a second failure occurs shortly after the first, the relationship quickly returns to normal. Recovery counters the effect of the complaint but, in almost all cases, does not entirely offset it.

Identifies sub‐groups of customers possessing specific personal characteristics (extreme type‐A, type‐B personalities, low self‐esteem, guilt‐propensity); examines disparities in the patterns of complaining behavior of the various categories; and assesses the implications of the differences observed. Of the respondents who reported having complained angrily, 82 percent continued to buy the products (or use particular suppliers). Some even increased purchasing levels.

	abstract = {Automobile purchasers were surveyed about feelings toward their inputs to and outcomes from the sales transaction, as well as their perceptions of the inputs and outcomes of the salesperson. Structural equation modeling with maximum likelihood estimation shows two concepts advanced in the equity literature, fairness and preference (advantageous inequity), to be related differentially to input and outcome judgments. No necessary symmetry is observed between the weights attached to inputs and outcomes or between those attached to self and salesperson. When framed in a larger perspective involving satisfaction with the salesperson, the fairness dimension mediates the effect of inputs and outcomes on satisfaction whereas preference does not. The fairness influence is robust against the simultaneous inclusion of disconfirmation in the satisfaction equation. Satisfaction, in turn, is related strongly to the consumer's intention cognitions. The findings suggest that the retail sales transaction may differ in substantive ways from the subject-peer and worker-coworker comparisons in other disciplines and that models of interpersonal satisfaction in the sales transaction should include the mediating effect of the fairness dimension of equity. The managerial implications of these findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {This article explores the effects of time and relationship strength on the evolution of customer revenge and avoidance in online public complaining contexts. First, the authors examine whether online complainers hold a grudge—in terms of revenge and avoidance desires—over time. They find that time affects the two desires differently: Although revenge decreases over time, avoidance increases over time, indicating that customers indeed hold a grudge. Second, the authors examine the moderation effect of a strong relationship on how customers hold this grudge. They find that firms' best customers have the longest unfavorable reactions (i.e., a longitudinal love-becomes-hate effect). Specifically, over time, the revenge of strong-relationship customers decreases more slowly and their avoidance increases more rapidly than that of weak-relationship customers. Third, the authors explore a solution to attenuate this damaging effect—namely, the firm offering an apology and compensation after the online complaint. Overall, they find that strong-relationship customers are more amenable to any level of recovery attempt. The authors test the first two issues with a longitudinal survey and the third issue with a follow-up experiment.},

Despite their popularity, bag-of-words models have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised algorithm that learns vector representations of sentences and text documents. This algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that our technique outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

            This paper studies the use of emotion and reason in political discourse. Adopting computational-linguistics techniques to construct a validated text-based scale, we measure emotionality in six million speeches given in U.S. Congress over the years 1858–2014. Intuitively, emotionality spikes during times of war and is highest in speeches about patriotism. In the time series, emotionality was relatively low and stable in earlier years but increased significantly starting in the late 1970s. Across Congress members, emotionality is higher for Democrats, for women, for ethnic/religious minorities, for the opposition party and for members with ideologically extreme roll-call voting records.},

While the marketing literature discusses storytelling, there is a lack of consensus because of the diverse conceptual and operational definitions used. To untangle the complexities and consolidate the fragmented knowledge about storytelling in marketing, this research examines how the marketing literature has addressed the influence of storytelling on consumers' purchasing behavior. The findings aid in understanding how the topic has been discussed from a marketing perspective in consumer behavior studies. Through a systematic literature review using a bibliometric analysis, we demonstrate that the marketing literature features four strands about the uses of storytelling to influence consumers' purchasing behavior. First, storytelling stimulates the consumer's identification with the brand. Second, storytelling allows consumers to experience emotional value. Third, storytelling supports engagement behaviors. Finally, storytelling has a downside in that it also propagates harmful speech. This study concludes with a roadmap for future research about how storytelling impacts consumers' purchasing behavior. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals {LLC}.},

The instruments were developed based on cybernetics and a systems-based approach, which allows for the understanding of the dynamics of growth variables in the halal cosmetics ecosystem. Based on data gathered, their relationships were mapped and major growth constraints were identified. Findings: Cybernetics and systems approach coupled with growth diagnostics framework has enabled identification of comprehensive growth constraint variables for halal cosmetics ecosystem and mapping of growth constraints (variables) in a relationships network. The study found that the enforcement activities of the National Pharmaceutical Research Agency (Cosmetics Unit) directly affect five growth constraints and is associated with three other growth constraint variables; subsequently the most binding growth constraint. The relationship network derived from the mapping of the growth constraints indicated that changes in the behaviour of any element will affect the overall operations of the ecosystem. Research limitations/implications: While the cosmetics industry is large and varied, this study is centred on halal colour cosmetics only. The growth constraint variables studied are those chosen by researchers and other growth constraints could be studied to guide policymakers. Future research can revolve around other halal cosmetics business sectors; impact of {IR}4.0 technology, {COVID}-19 pandemic impact; crisis and risk management issues, in the halal cosmetics industry. Practical implications: The results derived from the cybernetics analysis affirms the “outside-in” marketing perspective, thus stakeholders should continuously monitor changes in the halal cosmetics ecosystem to ensure to ensure sustainability and profitability. Small and medium enterprises ({SMEs}) and policymakers can initiate pre-emptive actions by conducting simulations of various situations on the halal ecosystem. Social implications: Enabled to simulate the effect of changes to the halal cosmetics ecosystem, stakeholders are able to take intervention initiatives, safeguard accessibility to halal cosmetics and make the halal cosmetics industry sustainable. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first comprehensive research to identify the growth constraints of the halal cosmetics industry in Malaysia that focusses on three groups of stakeholders (consumers, {SMEs} and government institutions) concurrently. The growth constraints relationship network of the halal cosmetics ecosystem can be further used to simulate the impact of changes within the system. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the current state of research on sustainability-related manufacturing trade-offs (i.e. giving preference and priority to one dimension over others) that affect suppliers in developed and less developed countries ({LDCs}). There is growing pressure on suppliers to adopt sustainable practices into their global supply chains. Successfully implementing all three dimensions of the triple bottom line ({TBL}) imperative can provide organizations with an added capability and potentially result in competitive advantage and a focus on sustainable development goals ({SDGs}) in the long run. However, designing supply chains for achieving the {TBL} requires suppliers to recognize and overcome numerous trade-offs. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review comprising 71 papers published between 2004 and 2020 was undertaken using a content analysis approach to identify trade-offs affecting suppliers. Findings: This study firstly identified eight sustainability-related trade-offs affecting suppliers from a {TBL} perspective in both developed and {LDCs}, consequently, allowing for a detailed discussion on trade-off factors and conditions unique to both developed and {LDCs}. Together, these findings enable this study to present initiatives and investment-related decisions for supply chains from a {TBL} perspective. Originality/value: In spite of the plethora of studies on sustainable supply chains, there is little research on trade-offs, specifically those affecting sustainability of suppliers operating in {LDCs}. This paper addresses this critical gap and advances the literature on sustainability-related supply chain trade-offs. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Preserving the environment is fundamental to the planet’s long-term sustainability, but attempts to promote pro-environmental behaviours often do not take into account the motivational determinants of such behaviours. This study aims to present and critically evaluate the theoretical and empirical basis of goal-framing theory, which asserts that pro-environmental behaviours might stem from conflicting goals. This study compares the theory to other approaches used to explain pro-environmental behaviour, reviews the empirical evidence for it and comes up with suggestions for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This study compares the theory with other popular theories to explain pro-environmental behaviour and behaviour change and systematically review 25 empirical research studies that adopt the goal-framing theory. Findings: Most studies rely on survey data, focus on Europe and gather self-reported behaviours or hypothetical responses. Furthermore, many studies of goal frames neglect key situational factors. Thus, the directions for further research outlined herein emphasise the need for more experimental studies of real behaviours, with consideration of situational factors, using methods that can explicate unconscious processes too. Overall, goal-framing theory provides a promising approach for analysing pro-environmental behaviours, in that it explicitly deals with goal conflicts, takes situational factors into account and encompasses conscious and unconscious processes. The authors conclude that the theory can form a useful basis for the design of social marketing behavioural interventions to promote pro-environmental behaviours. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, as the first systematic review of empirical applications of goal-framing theory, this study provides refinement and validation. By also offering propositions and a research agenda, the authors hope to inspire researchers in social marketing to address the remaining gaps and refine the theory even further. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Consumer food behavior has received considerable attention from marketers, researchers and regulators. With the rising obesity epidemic worldwide, the existing literature and previous reviews provide a limited understanding of consumers’ unhealthy food choices. To address this gap, this study aims to investigate consumer psychology for food choices in terms of mental processes and behavior. Design/methodology/approach: This systematic literature review analyzed 84 research papers accessed from the Web of Science database and selected high-quality marketing journals. A detailed analysis identified themes arranged in an organizing framework. Gaps, limitations, convergence and ambivalent findings were noted to derive future research directions. Findings: Major themes in the literature include food marketers’ actions (food stimuli and context), environmental influence (micro and macro) and consumer psychology and personal factors, leading to food choice related decisions. The antecedents and consequences of food choice healthiness are summarized. Several studies converged on the benefits of health motivations and goals, food literacy and customizing meals bottom-up on food choice healthiness. Research limitations/implications: This review helps researchers gain state-of-the-art understanding on consumer psychology for food choices. It presents ambivalent and converging findings, gaps and limitations of extant research to inform researchers about issues that need to be addressed in the literature. This review presents future research questions to guide research on critical issues. This literature review contributes to marketing domain literature on consumer’s food well-being and overall well-being. Practical implications: This review offers actionable insights for food marketers, policymakers and nongovernmental organizations to drive consumer demand for healthier foods, focusing on food labeling, food environment, message framing and raising consumer awareness. Originality/value: This review offers current understanding of consumer psychology for food choices focusing on healthiness, an aspect lacking in previous literature reviews. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study aims to find, analyze and synthesize prior literature to set the stage for future researchers and practitioners. It also uncovers research gaps, suggests potential research questions and presents a conceptual framework for use in future research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper catalogs and synthesizes topic-related literature by using the time-tested {SLR} methodology. It identifies and analyzes 99 relevant studies that have addressed the impact of advertising on unhealthy food consumption. Research profiling of the selected studies supported the synthesis of key themes in the extant literature. Findings: The authors identify three key thematic foci: a) viewer attributes pertaining to excessive unhealthy food consumption, b) advertisement attributes pertaining to excessive unhealthy food consumption and, c) unhealthy food consumption regulation. Within these themes, the authors also identify some subthemes, presenting specific advertising and viewer attributes that contribute to unhealthy food consumption. The authors further develop a conceptual framework based on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model, summarizing the findings of the study. This could aid future researchers and practitioners in their design of certain strategies. Research limitations/implications: The study uncovers various gaps in the extant literature and suggests potential areas that can be examined by scholars. From a practical perspective, the study recommends certain actionable strategies for policymakers, helping customers to achieve the long-term goal of obesity reduction. Practical implications: From the perspective of practice, the study recommends certain actionable strategies for policymakers helping customers achieve the long-term goal of obesity reduction. Originality/value: The current study makes a novel contribution to the research on advertising and unhealthy food consumption by identifying theme-based research gaps in the existing literature, mapping those with potential research questions and presenting a conceptual framework based on the S-O-R model.

Hence, this paper's primary objective was to provide an integrated competitiveness model for sports tourism destinations. A grounded theory methodology (paradigm model) was employed to construct the model and a systematic literature review technique for collecting data. This study reviewed and evaluated 25 papers from the Scopus and Web of Science databases until May 2021. The paradigm model identified and classified related variables with the central phenomenon (competitiveness of sports tourism destinations). The most significant contribution of this paper was developing a novel and integrated model to fill a theoretical gap in the literature on sports tourism, with a particular focus on destination competitiveness. As a result of the use of this model, policymakers will be able to understand better the requirements, strategies, and consequences of promoting competitiveness in sports tourism destinations.

By analyzing the research trends, theories, definitions and themes, the literature on financial capability is synthesized, and agenda for future research is suggested. A framework is presented that portrays the antecedents as well as the outcomes of financial capability and their interlinkages. Design/methodology/approach: Following a systematic approach, the review is based on 215 articles published during January 2007 and–March 2022, retrieved from Scopus. It presents the definitions and theories of financial capability, publication trends, influential articles, prominent authors, prolific journals and countries publishing on financial capability. Using bibliographic coupling, the intellectual structure of the topic is explored, along with offering a framework through content analysis. Findings: The bibliographic coupling analysis identifies four major clusters of research themes and capability theory appeared to be the most prominent theory. The synthesis draws upon five conceptual definitions of financial capability. Based on the discussion, in this review, financial capability is defined as an individual ability to apply appropriate financial knowledge, perform desirable financial behaviors and take available financial opportunities for achieving financial well-being. A conceptual framework delineates the synthesized literature and propositions based on this framework and relevant research are proposed. Finally, directions for future research are discussed.

Informed by these literature insights, the changing B2B channel dynamics that present within a digital era customer journey are appraised. An {OCM} model for B2B marketing campaign development is produced and avenues to further research are presented. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a systematic approach to explore {OCM} literature. This review informs an {OCM} model for B2B marketing campaign development to help advance conceptualisation of {OCM} B2B customer engagement as an emerging phenomena in the digital era. Findings: With just 21 papers identified, {OCM} is assumed to fit the criteria of an emerging concept as proposed in previous research studies. The proposed model presents the changing B2B omni-channel dynamics that can be used to create B2B {OCM} strategies, incorporating the myriad of B2B customer channels and touchpoints currently fabricating the modern B2B marketing terrain. Research limitations/implications: Conceptual in nature, there is a need for more empirical research to fully comprehend the emerging {OCM} landscape and how it relates to B2B customer dynamics. Originality/value: This research provides much-needed conceptualisation of data capture and management strategies for B2B marketing campaign development across the omni-channel in the digital era.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to systematically review and conceptualise service-related research on refugees to identify gaps in the literature, derive future research avenues and stimulate interdisciplinary research and practice to improve well-being of refugees. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a systematic literature review ({SLR}) of 102 journal articles published or available online from 2000 to 2020. Findings: Ten themes are identified across the three phases of the refugees’ service journey (entry, transition and exit). Most of the articles focus on the exit phase. One-third of the literature analyses refugees’ access and adaptation to health-care services. The dearth of research on other refugee services reflects the failure to attend to all aspects of service provision across all phases of the refugee service journey. Research limitations/implications: While the ten themes across the three phases require scholars’ and practitioners’ attention, different aspects of the {SLR}’s findings necessitate further investigation. To reinvigorate research and practice, and stimulate interdisciplinary collaboration, a novel Communities of Practice approach is suggested. Practical implications: Practitioners and policymakers should place more focus on the entry and transition phases of the refugee service journey. Social implications: Lack of research and engagement with the first two phases of the refugee journey might come at the expense of refugees. More service support is needed to buffer the journey from homeland to host country. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this {SLR} on refugee-related services is the first of its kind from a service research perspective. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	doi = {10.1177/15245004221117316},
	abstract = {Background: Socio-economic issues; such as social economic inequality, sustainability of resources, and environmental concern are major social concerns and the call for economic reforms to address these issues is growing louder. Sharing economy, as a socio-economic system, presents a solution to the current linear economic model having the potential to address the aforementioned socio-economic issues. Sharing, being environmentally friendly and sustainable in nature, bridges the gap of social economic inequality prevalent in society. The attributes of the sharing economy are different from the traditional economic model which is more “social” in nature, hence making social marketing techniques more suitable than the conventional marketing approach. Focus of the Article: The conceptual paper is focused on the application of social marketing in the sharing economy to address socio-economic issues and in doing so presents a framework to achieve its goal. Research Question: How can social marketing effectively influence social behavioural changes as they relate to socio-economic changes? Program Design/Approach: The framework developed outlines three levels of intervention for the successful implementation of social marketing in the sharing economy. The downstream intervention focuses on influencing consumer behavioural traits necessary for the adoption of the sharing economy by applying an appropriate marketing mix strategy. The upstream intervention focuses on policy and lawmakers, social and economic institutions, environmental groups, advocacy bodies, and lobbying organisations capable of addressing the root cause of the issue. The midstream intervention focuses on integrating upstream intervention with downstream through service providers. Importance to the Social Marketing Field: The research paper extends social marketing application from influencing social behavioural issues to addressing and influencing socio-economic issues with its proposed application in sharing economy. The study provides a framework to address key socio-economic (social economic inequality) and consumer behavioural issues (materialism and ownership) that are prevalent in society. Method: The proposed social marketing framework for the sharing economy is created after carrying out a systematic literature review on social marketing and sharing economy. The extant literature analysis focussed on key definitional parameters and their evolution over time. With the identification of key elements and benchmark framework, the three levels of social marketing intervention are developed and presented for the actionable implementation of a successful marketing strategy. Future Research: The research paper provides an initial framework for the social marketing intervention in the sharing economy and in influencing socio-economic change which opens the door for future research direction; what additional upstream and midstream social marketing intervention is necessary to bring socio-cultural and socio-economic change to tackle the issue of social economic inequality?

The theories and frameworks in the literature have not yet sufficiently explained the impact of {AI} on creativity in marketing. Hence, this research aims to advance theories on creativity in marketing and {AI} by conducting a comprehensive review of the literature. Our review covers 156 papers published between 1990 and 2021, compiled on the basis of the Scientific Procedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews ({SPAR}-4-{SLR}) protocol and the theory–context–characteristics–methodology framework. We advance theory in the field by proposing a new organizing framework to guide the integration of the identified themes and synthesize the antecedents, dimensions, and outcomes of creativity in marketing and {AI}. Furthermore, to assist academics and practitioners we propose a typology of the key skills required for creativity in marketing and the impact of specific {AI} capabilities on these skills. This article serves as a foundation for researchers by providing a holistic understanding of the integration of {AI} into creativity in marketing. © 2022 The Authors.

To synthesize B2B knowledge associated with organizational climates, we undertook a systematic review. Our results point toward six organizational climate dimensions, which have at their core issues related to Human Resources, Service, Interpersonal Relationships, Coordination, Environmental, and Exploration. Among these, the Exploration dimension is specific to B2B. Building from these dimensions, we highlight emerging research streams focused on interactions and relationships.

	abstract = {Purpose: A conceptual confusion has evolved in brand hate ({BH}) research mainly due to multiple conceptualizations, models and constructs in the field. As such, there is an urgent need to bring these insights together for a holistic understanding of research in {BH}, fostering its growth. This paper aims to fill this theoretical gap by bringing together the field of {BH} and delineating opportunities for further research. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted for a period of about two decades, from 1998 to August 2021. The authors included the English articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals with full texts relevant to this study, leading to a usable sample of 55 articles. Findings: The authors’ findings reveal that the literature has inadequately distinguished {BH} as emotion and relationship, while the theoretical domain used to explore {BH} remains largely dominated by the psychology literature. Furthermore, {BH} research has primarily focused on services, with little distinction made between hatred across product and service context, with most studies set in developed countries. The authors further identify the need to investigate boundary conditions influencing {BH} and develop a more robust measure of {BH} to capture its dynamic facet. Research limitations/implications: By presenting a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the research in {BH} and highlighting the future research avenues, this study is believed to spur scholarly research and serve as a valuable tool for the researchers in advancing the research in {BH}. Practical implications: Analysis of determinants and antecedents of {BH} provide managers an opportunity to nip the evil in the bud by preventing such situations that may lead to {BH}. Furthermore, insights into different {BH} consequences and boundary conditions allow brand managers to devise appropriate strategies to mitigate adverse reactions and foster positive consumer–brand relationships. Originality/value: This study provides a thorough analysis of the current state of {BH} research in one place and draws a road map for scholars to further the research in this area. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Method: A systematic literature review was conducted through three scientific research databases — Scopus, Web of Science, and {SciElo} — resulting in the in-depth analysis of 55 articles, and the mapping of how consumer behaviour is understood and categorised. Results: Variables such as norms, values, and beliefs, and the perception of product-related aspects are most likely to drive the purchasing behaviour of environmentally friendly products. Furthermore, price, difficulties in finding products, and lack of information are also viewed as significant barriers that discourage consumers from buying sustainable products. Theoretical contributions: This study intends to foster the academic discussion about how consumers perceive making purchasing decisions regarding products identified as more sustainable than the average on the market. It is believed that the comparison and categorization of distinct behavioural variables toward those green products can support further development of research on this topic.

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the time-tested systematic literature review method to identify 57 studies that have addressed B2B relationships in the health-care industry. Thereafter, a qualitative analysis is performed to delineate the research profile and synthesise the key themes examined in the selected studies. Findings: The qualitative analysis uncovers two key thematic foci: types and purposes of B2B relationships and pertinent issues in continued B2B relationships. Within these themes, the authors highlight different types of firms and their reasons for engaging in B2B relationships. The authors also summarise various issues that these firms deal with in such relationships. Finally, the authors highlight the limitations in the existing research and suggest future research questions to address them. The findings are summarised in a conceptual framework.

Substantial literature exists addressing different factors related to safety/security experience in different types of retail channels. However, what is missing is a unified framework to guide safe customer experience initiatives across all channels. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the safety elements in omnichannel retailing as perceived by customers and how these safety elements affect customer experience ({CX}) judgments and consumer behavior in a post-pandemic context. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review on safety/security studies in a retail context is conducted, followed by a qualitative study driven by a means-end-chain laddering technique collecting data from 62 retail customers in Australia, the {USA} and {UK}. Findings: Fourteen distinct safety elements in omnichannel retailing are identified. Four elements are relevant to the {CX} at the pre-purchase stage of the customer journey: social inclusiveness, role readiness, employment policy and safety policy enforcement. Six elements are relevant to the during-purchase stage: physical safety, personal hygiene, spatial distancing, fraud prevention, security surveillance and safety signal. The remaining four elements are relevant to the post-purchase stage: delivery safety, safety recall, mental health and data usage. Originality/value: This study presents a new unified framework addressing safety and security in post-pandemic retail service settings. The {SafeCX} framework offers researchers and managers a holistic understanding of the distinct safety elements that shape customers’ perceptions across each customer journey stage of the retail {CX}. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Despite its importance, most literature evaluating meta-analyses are based on data analysis and statistical discussions. This paper takes a holistic view, comparing meta-analyses to traditional systematic literature reviews. We described steps of the meta-analytic process including question definition, data collection, data analysis, and reporting results. For each step, we explain the primary purpose, the tasks required of the meta-analyst, and recommendations for best practice. Finally, we discuss recent developments in meta-analytic techniques, which increase its effectiveness in business research. © 2022 The Authors.

Considering the importance and proliferation of conversational commerce, it is opportune to take stock of the field's research from a bird's eye view to guide understanding of its current and future progress. In this regard, the goal of this study is to review the performance and intellectual structure of conversational commerce. To do so, this study conducts a comprehensive and systematic review of 722 publications on conversational commerce using the Scientific Procedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews protocol and a collection of bibliometric analysis techniques consisting of performance analysis and science mapping (e.g., content analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and bibliographic coupling). In doing so, this study reveals the performance (e.g., publication and citation trends, and top sources, publications, and authors) and the major theories and themes in the intellectual structure of the field. The study concludes with a conceptual framework depicting the constructs (e.g., antecedents, mediators, moderators, consequences, and enablers) of employing conversational agents for commerce and service delivery, as well as suggestions for its future research. © 2022 The Authors.

The research further determines the mechanisms enabling {SMEs} to process this knowledge, unpacks the benefits of both knowledge acquisition and transfer for international {SMEs} and links them to the market success. Design/methodology/approach: The research has conducted a comprehensive systematic review of existing literature on market knowledge acquisition and its transfer, in the context of international {SMEs}, utilizing peer-reviewed articles published in top tier journals without any custom range of time. Findings: The search strategy resulted in 37 reviewed academic articles, whose analysis identifies and elucidates on the best practices of knowledge acquisition and transfer in the context of international {SMEs}; the type of the knowledge acquired and transferred; the form and mechanism of the intersection of these processes; and the benefits gained. The findings, crucially, also identify and illuminate extant research gaps and insufficiencies and develop a comprehensive research agenda for the way forward. Originality/value: The present study offers a uniquely comprehensive perspective on a topic of diachronic and, currently, rising significance to scholars and practitioners alike. Transcending its descriptive value, though, it further identifies extant knowledge deficiencies, it distils and consolidates critical knowledge and prescribes avenues for research towards the growth and development of international {SMEs} and born globals. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation in business solutions is offering opportunities for servitization to become more digitalized. In this context, digital servitization requires the actors involved to perform new roles and develop new capabilities. Although servitization actor capabilities in the digital transformation context have been addressed in prior studies, the literature lacks a detailed understanding of how they operate according to different service types and different actor roles. Through a systematic literature review, our study aims to expound the capabilities required for digital servitization, for Base, Intermediate, and Advanced services, and analyze who of the main actors of the service triad (manufacturer, intermediaries, and customer) should own such capabilities. This analysis resulted in a final sample of 47 main articles addressing capabilities. We show how the structure of the service triad shifts the digital service provision based on the capabilities required by each actor. For instance, Base Services demand less capabilities, thus, intermediary actors play a less important role since they just execute services usually on behalf of a manufacturer in a more discrete capacity. For Intermediate Services, the intermediary actor becomes more important, with capabilities needed to deliver the digital solution. In Advanced Services, customers' relationships with manufacturers become stronger, as this actor reassumes a central role in the solution offer, and intermediaries move to a supporting role again. Our analysis offers propositions for future research on digital servitization and practical implications on the capabilities required. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

This paper aims to provide a structured view of the current literature and facilitates a theoretical understanding of value creation and capture in buyer–supplier relationships. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted on 195 articles published in 21 leading journals in marketing, operations management and strategy disciplines. Findings: An integrated, generalizable and expandable framework is proposed based on the causal or interactive relationship among four components, namely, dimensions of value creation; processes and interactions by which buyers and suppliers enable value creation; relationship characteristics that affect these components; and value capture. Two new areas for future studies are also suggested. Research limitations/implications: The findings are based on papers published in peer-reviewed academic literature. Future studies could include more heterogeneous publications in languages other than English and/or professional journals to compare scholars' and managers' perspectives. Practical implications: This study offers simple, practical guidelines that managers can apply in their real-world situations to increase the value they gain from their relationships. Originality/value: The framework does not pretend to be exhaustive because such an attempt would be impractical. Rather, this study provides practical examples for each component, and shows how additional concepts and constructs can be incorporated to make it inclusive and generalizable.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review ({SLR}) following the six-step {SLR} guidelines of Templier and Paré (2015) involved 1,051 articles, which were content analyzed. Findings: The authors offer two-pronged findings. First, on the basis of the {SLR}, the authors develop a new four-category classification scheme of needs to adopt {BDA} and present a consolidated review of the current knowledge base along with these categories (i.e. innovation, operational efficiency, customer satisfaction and digital transformation). Second, underpinned by the theory of organizational motivation and literature evidence, the authors develop propositions and a corresponding model of {BDA} adoption needs. The authors show that {BDA} adoption among B2B organizations is driven by the need to augment customer lifetime value, champion the change, improve managerial decision cycle-time, tap into social media benefits and align with market transformation. Research limitations/implications: The results facilitate theory development as the study creates a new classification scheme of needs and a model of needs to adopt {BDA} in large B2B organizations. Practical implications: The findings will serve as a guideline framework for managers to examine their {BDA} adoption needs and strategize its adoption. Originality/value: The study develops a new four-category classification scheme for understanding B2B organizations’ needs to adopt big data analytics. The study also develops a new model of needs which will serve as a stepping stone for the development of a theory of needs of technology adoption. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The motivations behind co-branding alliances, the differences in performance between the paired brands and the emergence of “spillover effects” have been pillars of the marketing research agenda for almost three decades. We observe an extensive number of studies on co-branding alliances, combined with multiple theoretical perspectives and empirical approaches informing extant literature. The purpose of this paper is to summarize of the state of the art of this research. Design/methodology/approach: The authors offer a systematic literature review of 190 papers on co-branding alliances. The authors portray a picture of the theories informing co-branding research and build a conceptual framework that summarizes the concepts and variables used in this literature. Finally, 11 interviews with managers and consultants of European firms help to reveal potential problems in practice and needs that are not captured by previous studies. Findings: The authors develop a map of theories used to investigate co-branding alliances and build a conceptual framework linking motivations, co-branding alliance implementation and outputs. Finally, the authors propose a structured research agenda. Research limitations/implications: The main implication relies on the structured research agenda. Practical implications: Practical implications include the identification of the variables and dimensions involved in a brand alliance to exploit the strengths and moderate the weaknesses of a brand. Originality/value: This paper highlights how co-branding is embedded in different contexts and dimensions regarding both firms and consumers. The two maps presented in this study underscore the interdependence among such dimensions. The authors interview marketing experts to validate the conceptual framework and to help us extract the managerial implications that stem from it. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to respond to calls in academia for an update of the product lifecycle ({PLC}). Through a systematic literature review, the authors provide an updated agenda, which aims to advance the {PLC} concept in research, teaching and practice. Design/methodology/approach: The authors started by surveying 101 marketing academics globally to ascertain whether a {PLC} update was viewed necessary and beneficial in the marketing community and thereafter conducted citation analysis of marketing research papers and textbooks to ascertain {PLC} usage. The subsequent literature review methodology was split into two sections. First, 97 empirical articles were reviewed based on an evaluative framework. Second, research pertaining to the {PLC} determinants were assessed and discussed. Findings: From the results of this review and primary data from marketing academics, the authors find that the method of predicting the {PLC} based on past sales has been largely unsuccessful and perceived as somewhat outdated. However, a new stream of {PLC} literature is emerging, which takes a consumer-centric perspective to the {PLC} and has seen more success at modeling lifecycles in various industries. Research limitations/implications: First, the study outlines the most contemporary and successful methodological approaches to modeling the {PLC}. Namely, the use of artificial intelligence, big data, demand modeling and consumer psychological mechanisms. Second, it provides several future research avenues using modern market trends such as sustainability, globalization, digitization and Covid-19 to push the {PLC} into the 21st century. Originality/value: The {PLC} has shown to be resolutely popular in management application and education. However, without a continued effort in academic {PLC} research to update the knowledge around the concept, its use as a productive management tool will likely become outdated. This study provides a necessary and comprehensive literature update resulting in actionable future research and teaching agendas intended to advance the {PLC} concept into the modern market context. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Although sustainability research within B2B marketing scholarship has increased in recent years, the B2B literature relating to the Sustainable Development Goals remains fragmented and underexposed. To address this important oversight, a systematic literature review of the B2B marketing literature (n = 58) is undertaken which demonstrates if and how B2B scholarship is currently engaging with the Sustainable Development Goals. The findings and analyses highlight that although the B2B scholarship has varying levels of engagement with some of the goals, there is vast opportunity for B2B Marketing scholars to engage more proactively and strategically with the Sustainable Development Goals.

This article explores the current literature on the conceptualization of self-control on social media. For this, 25 papers from seven academic databases were analyzed in the chronological order in a systematic literature review. The sequence of applied frameworks demonstrates a gradual switch from theories of planned behavior to theories justifying non-planned behavior and self-control failures. This finding explains the emphasis of recent studies on the impulsive behavior of excessive social media users and the application of dual-system theories. However, research design of selected articles included mainly self-report tools to investigate impulsive self-control failures which may result in contradictory findings and deficient theoretical grounding for self-control interventions. All investigated papers claim a negative impact of social media self-control failures on personal well-being. © 2021 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Risk in the Halal food supply chain is considered as the failure to deliver the product which complies with Halal standards. The purpose of this paper is to identify the risk elements associated with Halal food supply chains and prioritise them appropriately towards better management. Design/methodology/approach: This research used a systematic literature review to identify various risk elements in the Halal food supply chain and consolidate them with the expertise of professionals and academicians. Further, the fuzzy analytic hierarchical process (fuzzy {AHP}) is applied to prioritise the identified risk elements. Findings: The findings of the research suggest that “supply-related risks” are the most prominent risk. Raw material integrity issue is a vital element in the Halal food supply chain. The failure of the supplier to deliver material that complies with Halal standards reduces the industrial economic advantage. This study recommends that the integration of internal processes and outsourcing elements can mitigate the risk of the Halal food supply chain by having a holistic view of the processing and delivery of Halal foods. Research limitations/implications: Systematic literature review and experts’ opinion are used to identify and consolidate risks. For the literature review, only the {SCOPUS} database is used; thus, there is a chance to overlook some risk elements. Additionally, the fuzzy {AHP} analysis depends on relative preference weight. Therefore, care should be taken while constructing a pairwise comparison matrix for risk elements. Practical implications: The findings of the study can help the managers who have a holistic view on risk mitigation of the Halal food supply chain. This study may assist managers to share information about the processing of Halal food from top to bottom to manage risk. Originality/value: This study may act as a baseline for undertaking future research in the area of risk management of the Halal food supply chain. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The objective of this paper is to increase understanding of social media in international business context. To this end, the authors make an attempt to integrate the existing, still somewhat limited views in a framework that advances the knowledge of scholars and decision-makers on this topic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a conceptual study supported by use of a systematic literature review method. Findings: This study shows marketing as a dominant area of discussion and reveals that many firm functions where social media plays a role have received relatively little attention. Furthermore, the study shows that the positive features of social media in international activity tend to be more widely acknowledged and better understood than the potentially problematic aspects. Research limitations/implications: The number of articles analyzed in this study was relatively small, resonating with the nature of an emerging research area. Research on social media has only taken off over the last years, and it is understandable that there is limited research that connects it specifically to phenomena of international business. Practical implications: This study reminds managers to be cautious when using social media in international markets. The relationship between social media and international business exhibits dynamism and is dependent on a variety of factors. Social media does not come without costs, nor is easily transferred from one market to another. Efficient use of this media in the international context may increase the need of specific and qualified human resources, and it may necessitate having the whole process from R\&D to delivery, and beyond, ready for adaptation. Originality/value: It can be argued that we know too little about the relevant factors and relationships between social media and international business. The authors hope that this study revealing the scarcely studied aspects and suggesting a tentative framework for capturing the dynamics of social media and international business can guide subsequent research and accelerate its emergence. © 2022, Matti Saari, Lauri Haapanen and Pia Hurmelinna-Laukkanen.},

We used the systematic literature review ({SLR}) methodology, resulting in the analysis of 61 articles obtained from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Results identified five themes in higher education co-creation: (1) student’s role in higher education service and management; (2) expectations of the educational service value; (3) barriers and facilitators of co-creation; (4) impacts and benefits of co-creation; and (5) tools and practices to foster co-creation. Based on the literature review and the service-dominant logic (S-D logic), we identified that co-creation in higher education involves both services co-creation (service as output) and value co-creation, leading us to propose a differentiation of these concepts. The paper also contributes by identifying a conceptual framework to analyse the phenomenon and the presentation of future research directions. © 2022 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The luxury experience is a growing and crucial component of luxury marketing. Experiences inspire consumers to engage with luxury brands. Although several research studies have shed light on the origin, development, and prominence of luxury experiences among consumers, there is a scarcity of research that analyzes the current knowledge holistically. As a result, this study uses a systematic literature review technique to better understand the trends in the luxury experience and consumer behavior literature and suggests future research directions to further develop the subject area. Design/methodology/approach: Using the theory-context-characteristics-methodology ({TCCM}) framework, this study examines 130 articles on the luxury experience and consumer behavior. Findings: Most research on luxury experiences has focused on the luxury service experience in the context of hospitality and tourism. Future researchers should explore avenues for providing luxury experience to consumers in the luxury products industry. In addition, more research is needed into the influences of the recent {COVID}-19 outbreak and technological advancements on consumers' luxury experiences. Originality/value: The study is unique as it (1) presents a state-of-the-art understanding of the luxury experience and consumer behavior literature by analyzing the applied theories, research contexts, study characteristics, and methods used in the past studies and (2) suggests future research opportunities to advance the field. The findings will also assist luxury brand managers in designing a consumer's exceptional luxury experience. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Recent research has recognised the importance of supply chains and ecosystems as key drivers of successful servitization strategies, especially in the context of inter-organisational relations ({IOR}). The body of knowledge has, however, become increasingly fragmented and diverse due to different disciplinary roots of both servitization and {IOR} research. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of current knowledge and to generate a set of future research directions for servitization-related supply chain and ecosystem research. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review methodology was applied. A thematic analysis was conducted on a sample of 34 papers in the period 2010–2021 to identify the key themes within the servitization-related supply chain and ecosystem literature. Findings: The review revealed a limited, but expanding, knowledge base for servitization-related supply chain and ecosystem research. The findings provide insight into current trends across four thematic areas: theoretical orientation, methodological approaches, research context and research content. Within these themes, it was found that four main areas of research content have been studied (supplier relationships, risk perception and uncertainty, capability development and resource integration), with most research adopting case-based methodologies within three main industrial contexts: manufacturing, industrial and software. Finally, a broad range of theoretical orientations have led to an increasingly fragmented and diverse literature base. Originality/value: This study is the first to review servitization-related supply chains and ecosystems. It contributes insights through an {IOR} lens to categorise and organise a core set of themes and concepts for servitization-related supply chain and ecosystems research. It identifies research gaps within the extant literature and presents a set of future research directions. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The formation of alliances between organisations is increasingly common, allowing firms to discover and ensure competitive advantages. This research paper aims to make a critical analysis of studies to understand the role of communication between partners in the process of strategic alliances. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was carried out, using the Web of Science database to obtain data, associating the terms “communication” and “strategic alliances”, which resulted in 240 scientific articles (published between 1993 and March 2021). After data treatment using {VOSviewer} software and reading of the contents, the final sample consisted of 179 articles on the subject in question. Findings: The conceptual limits, exploratory descriptive analysis of the data and content analysis of research methods are presented, with five clusters being identified. The results show growing academic interest in studying communication associated with strategic alliances, and authors’ main interest lies in understanding the critical success factors and the relation between communication and knowledge. Practical implications: This study corroborates understanding of the future of alliances, assuming that learning is the main objective; trust is the factor determining success or failure; technology is the aggregating tool; culture affects the relation; and communication is not an end but a means to construct consolidated, long-lasting and high-performing strategic alliances. Originality/value: This study is innovative in strategic alliances area. The research confirms that the main factor in forming alliances, in both emerging and international markets, is the learning intention. This fact reinforces the relevance of the learning made possible by this transfer of know-how through communication. In addition, this study gives critical understanding of how the process of communication between partners in an alliance must be distinct; i.e. it must be flexible enough to adjust to the stage in the alliance’s life cycle. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Meal ordering apps ({MOAs}) have transformed the customers' dining habits, particularly during mobility restrictions of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Under the theoretical cover of the extended stimulus–organism–response ({SOR}) model, this paper attempts to explore the critical antecedents and outcomes of customer {MOA} engagement which predict the continuous purchase intentions using these apps. A multigroup analysis is conducted to investigate the difference between the hypothesized relationships between the Chinese and Indonesian consumers. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method approach, including a systematic literature review, an open-ended essay (qualitative) with 139 {MOA} users and an online survey (quantitative) with 1,207 {MOA} users in total, was used for hypotheses testing. Findings: The structural equation model results revealed that customer {MOA} experience factors such as mobile online reviews ({MR}), food quality ({FQ}), restaurant reputation ({RR}), service quality and system quality ({SyQ}) are the absolute positive factors that influence customer {MOA} cognitive, affective and behavioral engagement, which in turn affect continuous purchase intentions. The multigroup analysis results reveal that Chinese customers prioritized {MR} and {FQ} for customer {MOA} engagement (cognitive, affective and behavioral). Comparatively, Indonesian customers placed most importance on {RR} and {SyQ}. Originality/value: Considering a market-specific setting and based on the extended {SOR} framework, this study is one of the first to take a comprehensive look at the critical antecedents and outcome of multidimensional customer {MOA} engagement in the developing countries’ (China and Indonesia) online to offline meal delivery context. Further, this study investigates the customer continuous purchase intentions as an outcome of {MOA} engagement during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. The findings also reveal the differences in consumer behavior across the two developing but culturally diverse countries samples during the pandemic. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Hence, the purpose of this study is to understand the trends and evolution of {RM} and relationship quality ({RQ}) in B2B contexts and empirical insights on {RM} and {RQ} in B2B, which in turn would provide insights into trends and future research directions. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on the industrial marketing and purchasing group, this study adopts a critical systematic literature review to provide a comprehensive analysis of the past, current and future trends in empirical research insights of {RM} and {RQ} in B2B markets. Findings: This study provides some novel insights into {RM} in B2B context by using a multidimensional approach to {RM} and {RQ} and analyzing prior marketing research from three perspectives: the evolution of {RM} and {RQ} in B2B context; prior empirical research; and practical business insights.

	abstract = {With the rise of feminist and social movements, new sorts of advertisements have emerged, signaling a change toward a more gender-neutral portrayal. Femvertising is a new type of advertising that aims to show women in an equal and diverse way. It strives to empower women while avoiding depictions of traditional gender stereotypes and sexuality. The aim of this study is to analyze all the research on female stereotypes in advertising conducted between January 2000 and March 2021 during the various stages of feminism: pre-feminism, feminism, and post-feminism. The systematic literature review method is used in this study, and it discusses the key research methods, the context (country, sector), and the main research topics related to female stereotypes in advertising. In addition to identifying future research directions, the current study seeks to determine the place and role of femvertising in relation to the different feminist periods. The findings reveal that the vast majority of the studies rely on data from a single nation, with research in the United States and the United Kingdom dominating the field. About half of the studies in the current article gathered data from only one sector, with the apparel industry receiving the most attention. The other most prominent sectors in the research were beauty, personal care, and advertising. Except for the studies related to femvertising, qualitative studies predominated in all periods of feminism. The reviewed articles identify the major research trends related to consumer attitudes, the evolution of female portrayal in advertising, the objectification of women, and the social movement of women empowerment. The number of articles on the latter topic has been rapidly increasing in recent years, owing to the femvertising trend. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland {AG}.},

	abstract = {With an estimated 1.1 billion unbanked adults in the world, mobile financial services, including mobile money services are being used to increase access to low-cost financial services (Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2018). Although mobile financial services are growing at a dynamic and rapid pace, the share of adults (44\%) in developing countries reported to using digital payments with mobile phones or the internet is still low (Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2018). There still remains a large percent of the population in {BoP} (base of the pyramid) markets with limited access to sustainable formal financial services like credit, savings, payment systems, insurance and pension (Ouma et al. 2017). The growth and potential of mobile financial services in {BOP} markets is well documented in practitioner reports (e.g. {GSMA}- Mobile for Development report, World Bank- Global Findex reports, Deloitte- Leveraging digital to unlock the base of the pyramid market in Africa report). Mobile phones and the internet have given rise to a new generation of financial services, sparking a digital revolution. Although {BOP} market literature has mention that the mobile financial services process is becoming increasingly dynamic with benefits to many stakeholders, there has been little light thrown on mobile financial inclusion processes and outcomes. Hence, the main aim of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review and synthesize the literature on strategies to upscale utilitarian and hedonic benefits to all consumers at the micro, meso and macro levels – all stakeholders - to get a comprehensive understanding of mobile financial inclusion. We employed a systematic literature review approach for this study as our data collection method. Systematic literature review ({SLR}) is a distinct and organized method to analyze and assess literature (Briner and Walshe 2014). We have proposed a conceptual model to delineate mobile financial services usage in {BOP} markets. The model shows the factors that take place prior to mobile financial services usage among {BOP} consumers, as well as the usage experience and outcomes associated with {MFS} at the {BOP}. As such, this model serves as a visual representation of the previously discussed antecedents, usage experience, outcomes, and strategy. Additionally, we specify that the mobile financial services environment includes micro level household strategies, meso level firm strategies, and macro level national strategies. These micro, meso and macro level relationships require continuous re-adaptations amongst stakeholders for increasing dynamism in {MFS}. Mobile financial services present an opportunity for financial inclusion and poverty alleviation. Consequently, understanding the antecedents, process and outcomes associated with their use and provision is key. Our conceptualization of the mobile financial services process and environment suggest that precursors impact mobile financial services usage which in turn impacts outcomes additionally elements of the micro, meso, and macro environment impact each of these elements. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland {AG}.},

A multi-actor perspective is considered valuable for understanding the process of servitization. This study aims to review the contemporary research on organizing servitization by multi-actor collaborations. Design/methodology/approach: The approach of systematic literature review was used. In total, 90 English-language journal articles published from 2004 to 2021 were selected based on a series of rigorous steps. Furthermore, descriptive and thematic analyses were conducted to answer the predefined review questions. Findings: The servitization research from the multi-actor collaboration perspective is an infant field yet growing increasingly. An integrative framework was proposed to reveal the extant related studies. In this framework, three typical servitization lenses emphasizing multi-actor collaborations were uncovered. Moreover, six categories of influence factors and possible positive and negative outcomes for this process were identified. Existing knowledge gaps and underlying research directions were also discussed to lay the foundations for future research. Research limitations/implications: This research has been limited by the usage of single database, rigorous selection criteria by the Academic Journal Guide ({AJG} 2018) list and exclusion of non-English papers. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the earliest systematic literature reviews to explore the servitization issues by adopting a multi-actor perspective. The findings can consolidate the knowledge base of servitization and provide implications for the multiple fields of industrial marketing, operational management, information management and service marketing. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Literature is examined from searches of {ProQuest}, {EBSCO}, Emerald Plus and Google Scholar to create a road map of extant knowledge published from 1987 to 2021 in marketing and consumer related fields. Five themes associated with {ROI} measurement research are identified across four time periods: Cost reduction, Organisational learning, Reputational effect, Current customer focus and Social benefits. Few studies develop a comprehensive conceptual framework for the calculation of the {ROI}. The current literature is then extended, with the development of a framework to assist complaint management researchers and practitioners to evaluate Customer Complaint Management practices. The framework also informs the necessary data collection. Finally, new research directions are outlined to guide scholarly enquiry. © 2022 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.},

To understand how the purchase decision process occurs in social media, we conducted a systematic literature review to address Q1: what are the main factors impacting consumers buying behaviour the literature has brought to light? We also addressed Q2: how has the perception of marketing in social media evolved in recent years? Our results show six different reasons (trust, price, product's quality, influencer endorsement, word of mouth, and advertising) that motivate social media customers' purchase behaviour. Moreover, four of these reasons (trust, product's quality perception, influencer endorsement and word of mouth) are directly influenced by a factor inherent in the characteristics of social media, the social interaction. The {COVID}-19 pandemic has also led many consumers to buy through social media and we believe this is a permanent move. Copyright © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {While entrepreneurial orientation ({EO}) in nonprofit organizations ({NPOs}) is often considered as another business-like behavior, the present systematic literature review changes this perspective by revealing that the construct refers to several specific third sector organizations' qualities and leverages financial and mission goals simultaneously. {EO} as a strategic posture of organizations is already well established in management and strategy literature whereas corresponding insights in {NPOs} are indeed expanded, but fragmented. To develop this research stream, a systematic literature review was conducted, that analyses the results of 76 studies about {EO} in {NPOs}. Besides describing current findings, this paper generates a comprehensive overview of applied constructs, drivers influencing {EO}, and goals promoted by this strategic posture. The context-specific modification of the construct leads to the presumption that {EO} does not predominantly target business-like initiatives, but holds a lot of potential meeting {NPO}'s core challenges, such as the fulfillment of various stakeholders' expectations or diverse resources acquisition. The discussion elaborates to what extent {EO} serves as a viable alternative to highly discussed third sector developments of business approximation. © 2022 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors followed guidelines for systematic literature reviews with stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review is based on 79 research papers published from 2000 to 2020 in 21 reputed peer-reviewed international journals. The papers were analyzed and synthesized based on their defining characteristics, methodologies, major constructs and themes addressed. Findings: The literature synthesis indicated that consumers have to make a trade-off between 11 perceived benefits and six perceived sacrifices to improve their net perceived value before making the final decision to adopt online shopping. It is important to decode these factors as they could improve both the functional and recreational value of the shopping experience for online consumers, resulting in an improvement in conversion rates from a prospect to the final purchase at e-stores. This could improve turnover as well as profits for the e-tailers. Originality/value: This study pioneers to consolidate these factors through the lens of the value adoption model. This study also suggests insightful directions for further research perspectives in the online context from both consumers' and retailers' perspectives. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a diagnostic instrument of the maturity of Industry 4.0 technologies adapted to the textile and clothing sector and constructed based on the technological references that support this industrial evolution process. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed methodology began with the systematic literature review using the {SciMAT} software and then a questionnaire was developed with 49 questions divided into 5 categories – demography, technologies, strategy, digital skills and benefits of the deployment. Findings: The application in 19 different sectors and 72 people in a textile industry showed this sector is still traditional. The diagnosis results pointed that the level of implementation of Industry 4.0 is considered the first level, later advancing in this order to levels of connectivity, visibility, predictability and adaptability of the processes. Research limitations/implications: Only in one company was applied the developed instrument, in this case study, a factory that makes children's and adult clothing items located in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Practical implications: Through the use of this assessment instrument, it is possible to perform an internal benchmarking at the company detecting the strong and weak points, as well as involve a multidisciplinary collaborator team. Social implications: The comparisons and improvements may be carried out per dimension or sector, which motivates the constant application and assessment of improvements. The instrument to diagnose the maturity of Industry 4.0 technologies in the textile and clothing sector is considered an effective tool for application in a single company or to have its use expanded in a new piece of research to the entire industrial textile segment. Originality/value: The developed diagnostic tool may be used for both the internal assessment of the company and its placement relative to its competitors, involving several companies from the same sector. It is possible to know about what level of Industry 4.0 maturity the company is and after benchmarking by others and improve. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Five major themes characterizing consumer self-concept construction and disclosure online emerge: self-narration in digital spaces, ambivalence between the virtual and real self, digitization and self-enhancement, self and digital possessions, and privacy protection. Based on each topic, future research avenues have been identified. The analysis will help scholars identify some core issues and challenges that require further enquiry.

	abstract = {Driven by the rapid development of augmented reality ({AR}) in retail and e-commerce along with the unique ability of {AR} to add virtual content in a highly contextual and controllable manner, academic research has recently grown rapidly. This study is a systematic literature review and proposes a holistic view on the current knowledge on {AR} in retail and e-commerce, including the current state of the research and the factors influencing consumers responses. We found that the topic is still scattered between various literature streams focusing on different marketing phenomena, such as consumer decision-making, consumer experience, self-brand connection and negative effects. The first research stream addresses decision making and involves research on {AR} as a decision-aid improving ease of decision in different ways depending on product types and consumers’ characteristics (e.g., Heller et al. 2019). The second stream recognizes that in addition to utilitarian value, {AR} also creates hedonic and experiential value, which increase satisfaction and behavioral intentions (purchase, patronage and technology usage) (e.g., Dacko 2017; Poushneh 2018). The third stream is labeled self-brand connection and refers to the potential of the {AR} experience to trigger self-referencing and self-brand connection aspects, such as self-brand connection and self-brand congruity (e.g., Baek et al. 2018; Phua and Kim 2018). The fourth stream addresses the negative effects of {AR} that entail concepts closely related to privacy concerns, such as perceived intrusiveness, discomfort, and users' control of access to personal information, as well as a media irritation including issues about app quality (e.g., Poushneh 2018). {AR} experience induces flow (Javornik 2016), which can create long-term relationships (Steinhoff et al. 2019). Although flow may be powerful to create or revive a long-term relationship, as it creates excitement it may divert consumers’ attention. Further research should address the differences in flow that arise through the consumer journey. In addition, {AR} intertwines self and brand by presenting them in a same view, in a believable manner and creates positive brand-related outcomes. Although, personalization could bring backlashes on the form of privacy concerns. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland {AG}.},

	abstract = {According to Bagozzi (1974) one core task of marketing is to facilitate exchange between buyers and sellers. In the recent past several drivers like technology developments and enhanced concern for sustainability have shaped new forms of exchange that challenge the classical way how marketing operated between buyers and sellers. The sharing economy and other terminologies used in this context represent a rapid growing part of our economies in which you can consume without having to buy and own. Shared mobility, the shared use of a mode for transportation, is one of the biggest and most important industry of the worldwide sharing economy ({McKinsey} and Company 2017). Within the sharing economy the concept of peer-to-peer sharing and collaborative consumption (P2P {SCC}) is a subset and one specific form in where users can act as both as consumer as well as provider. Assets, goods and services are provided by the network of users itself and not by or many companies. Therefore, P2P {SCC} plays an essential part as, on the one hand, it offers many societal and environmental benefits (Perren and Kozinets 2018; Benjaafar et al. 2019), e.g. better usage of underutilized assets, and on the other hand, it has brought forth some well-known and successful companies, such as {BlaBlaCar}. Marketing research in the last decade has seen the rise of the sharing economy as well as the implications for research on this topic (Eckhardt et al. 2019). In this context a lot of research has been done about B2C sharing that has increased our understanding in many respects, e.g. distinguishing between different classical and sharing forms of exchange. Since P2P {SCC} can still be considered a young phenomenon, management research, particularly from a marketer’s point of view, is still at its beginning, e.g. when it comes to understand distinctive features between and within these new form of exchange (Benoit et al. 2017; Lin et al. 2019). Based on a systematic literature review (Tranfield et al. 2003) and an inductive qualitative analysis (Mayring 2014) we deduce a set of characteristics and attributes and propose a categorization for P2P {SCC} to contribute to this research gap. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland {AG}.},

Unsurprisingly, a research trend on cross-cultural {eWOM} has emerged. However, there has not been an attempt to synthesize this research topic. This paper aims to bridge this gap. Methodology: This research paper conducts a systematic literature review of the current research findings on cross-cultural {eWOM}. Journal articles published from 2006 to 2021 are included. This study then presents the key issues in the extant literature and suggests potential future research. Findings: The findings show that there has been an upward trend in the number of publications on cross-cultural {eWOM} since the early 2010s, with a relatively steeper increase toward 2020. The findings also synthesize cross-cultural {eWOM} research into four elements and suggest potential future research avenues. Value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is currently no exhaustive/integrated review of cross-cultural {eWOM} research.

Methodology: A systematic literature review is performed using Methodi Ordinatio in Scopus database. Papers are ranked according to their relevance and reviewed using content analysis techniques and oblique approach. Main results: Although several authors do not make use of the term soft power itself, most of them obliquely allude to its concept, from where we draw inferences for future research. Contributions: Through Methodi Ordinatio, we identified the most relevant articles on the object of study. Analyzing them, our main contribution is an array of guidelines for future research on soft power in six areas: psychosociology, labor mobility, urban planning, arts diplomacy, gastrodiplomacy, and geographical indications. Relevance and originality: to our knowledge, the triangle of creative industries, place branding, and soft power has been studied only to a very limited extent, and this seems to be the first article to link it to the aforementioned areas. Managerial and social implications: Not only does this triangle contain uncharted theoretical challenges, but it also puts forward underexplored areas by practitioners and policy-makers, provoking insights for the image planning of cities, regions, and countries. The need for further studies notwithstanding, the areas involving arts and gastronomy seem to be feasible initiatives for the short-term, meanwhile the other ones may be more time and cost consuming. © 2022 Revista Brasileira de Marketing.

	abstract = {Health information plays a significant role in the health behavior of individuals. Word-of-mouth ({WOM}) is essential in this context. In recent years, new forms of online communication have greatly expanded the possibilities for seeking information and, in consequence, significantly changed communication behavior. Similarly, the doctor-patient relationship has gradually evolved and the traditional asymmetry of medical knowledge is increasingly being corrected as today’s health care consumers are becoming more well-informed. A key source of information is either in-person or online {WOM}. A research gap exists in terms of analyzing the current state of research of {WOM} in health care. Although various studies highlight the influence of {WOM} on health behavior, to the best of our knowledge there exists no systematic literature review that summarizes the current state of research on {WOM} in health care. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review on {WOM} in health care. The literature review investigates existing {WOM} studies in the health care sector based on a systematic search for articles in a twenty-year timeframe from January 2000 to December 2019. The resulting total of 34 articles constitutes the basis of this paper. These studies are analyzed using a model of {WOM} in health care and – based on the theory of cognitive dissonance, the theory of the strength of weak ties, and the theory of perceived risk – clustered into the creation, spread, and impact of {WOM}. The investigated studies emphasize the importance of the staff in the service process. Furthermore, negative reviews have a stronger impact than positive ones, with service quality representing the main reason for negative {WOM}. In addition, the importance of electronic word-of-mouth ({eWOM}) is underlined, as online reviews are gaining popularity for patient decision-making processes. Although some studies have addressed {WOM} in health care, research gaps remain. For example, there are few studies on {eWOM} and some medical disciplines in private practice are neglected in {WOM} research. By systematically presenting and analyzing the literature on {WOM} in health care, this paper represents an important starting point for future research and also provides insights into the role of {WOM} in health care practice. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Following a systematic literature review and a longitudinal case study of the 2014 {FIFA} World Cup based on interviews with social movement leaders and archival data from traditional media and social media, we argue that sociocultural contexts are not always stable and may shape (i.e. provide social norms and ideologies for) and anchor (i.e. offer mobilisable resources for) the actions of social movements and brands. We establish the notions of Convergent Sociocultural Shaping and Convergent Sociocultural Anchoring–and their antitheses–to illustrate different scenarios in connection to the impact of sociocultural contexts on activism and brands. © 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.},

	abstract = {Cause-Related Marketing ({CRM}) is one of the most versatile activities among the Corporate Social Responsibility ({CSR}) initiatives. Though {CRM} is extensively researched, however, only a few authors have performed systematic literature reviews on {CRM}. Therefore, more systematic reviews of {CRM} are still needed to complete and bring together the more contributions, advances, and different existing research lines. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the existing literature in {CRM} from the two keywords: “Cause-Related Marketing” and “Cause Marketing”, and the time period ranges from 1988 to 2020. In this study, rigorous protocol is used in synthesizing 344 English articles drawing upon e-journal database searches. These articles were categorized by time-wise development, country-wise development, methodological development, cross-cultural analysis, the role of journals. This study also carried out the Bibliometric Analyses. The review highlights that the concept of {CRM} has evolved from being considered a marketing mix tool (a promotion tool), to being considered as a {CSR} initiative, with a more strategic character. Our findings revealed that only a few journals published articles on {CRM}. Geographically, the {CRM} study was initiated in North America, followed by Europe and Oceania, and Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries. From the third decade, there was more collaboration in cross-cultural studies and the use of mixed-method (qualitative and quantitative studies) approach. Lastly, this study shows the most manifest research gaps in {CRM} that opens avenue for future research. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: With the explosion of digital technologies in contemporary daily life, fuelled by a pandemic and remote working, online learning and shopping and the proliferation of social platforms, much remains nebulous about the opportunities these technologies hold for social marketers beyond their previously documented use as communication and promotion tools. This paper aims to provide a rich examination of the variety of digital technologies used within social marketing and establish the scale of integration between digital technologies and social marketing. Design/methodology/approach: Following systematic literature review procedures, a systematic literature review through eight databases was conducted. The systematic review focussed on the assessment of social marketing studies that incorporated a wide range of mature and emerging digital technologies such as the internet, mobile platforms and social media channels. A total of 50 social marketing studies (2014–2020) were analysed. Findings: The review found that there have been major advancements in the technologies available to social marketers in recent years. Furthermore, the adoption of digital technologies by social marketers has evolved from a communication or promotion function where generic information is pushed to the citizen, towards the use of these technologies for a more personalised design, content and behaviour change intervention. In some studies, the digital technologies were the primary means for interactions and collaborations to take place. The review also found that digital technologies target more than the individual citizen. Digital technologies are used to target multi-level stakeholders, policy makers and partners as part of behavioural change interventions. Originality/value: Only two previous reviews have synthesised digital technologies and their use in social marketing. This review provides a recent depiction of the range and scale of integration within social marketing. Specifically, it demonstrates the expansion beyond a persuasive application to their use for research, segmentation and targeting, collaboration and co-creation, the product and facilitator of service delivery. Finally, this review provides a heat map to illustrate the integration between digital technologies and key concepts and criteria within social marketing. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: Through the systematic literature review, 13 design elements were obtained and then verified through interviews of 30 professional designers. The obtained elements were made into a questionnaire to collect data across China from 1,016 consumers of different groups. Data were analyzed using cluster analysis, principal component analysis and difference analysis. Findings: The results show that design elements that influence consumer experience in shopping malls are a four-dimensional construct: visual atmosphere, physical environment comfort, space structure and business planning, among which space structure and business planning play a larger role in the consumer experience. In addition, the perception differences of consumers for those elements are significant due to the individual differences. Originality/value: This paper comprehensively investigates the architectural design elements affecting consumer experience in the Chinese mall context. Moreover, it provides unique insights about the relationship between architectural design and consumer experience by exploring the categories, weights and perception differences of those elements. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Lean manufacturing ({LM}) has advocated gains by reducing waste and intensifying continuous improvement. As a holistic organizational policy, it must overpass the limits of the manufacturing function. Management accounting should be aligned to lean thinking, aiming to meet the demands and goals of a lean organization. This paper aims to investigate the degree of alignment between management accounting systems and {LM} practices. Design/methodology/approach: Two representative case studies were carried out in industry leaders in the implementation of {LM}, in Brazil. The key research constructs and were identified by means of a systematic literature review. The rhetoric and practice concerning the alignment between management accounting and {LM} are discussed based on the existing theory and the conducted case studies. Findings: The analysis showed that many of the principles that form the rhetoric of lean accounting are far from the accounting practices observed in the companies. Using the theory-building function of case studies, 10 propositions to be tested in future research are proposed. The main propositions are also summarized in a framework based on analogies with optical lenses. Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, there are no previous in-depth studies focusing on characterizing this alignment between management accounting and {LM} practices. The analysis yields prescriptive directions for managers that seek to improve this alignment in their business. This study also proposes a five-stage maturity model, which can be used by the managers to assess this alignment and to set goals for reaching more advanced levels of maturity. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper summarized an in-depth study of research papers, articles, and reports since 1990 and also provided insights into the consumer behavior in responding to, adopting the green products, and identifying the factors (whether personal factors or environmental factors) which are responsible for the significant inclination and rise in consumption of green products. The literature review highlighted that the benefits of using green products and their association with others like environment, biodiversity, and ecological sustainability were not successfully and effectively communicated to the consumers. It was also observed that competition in creating a brand in their respective categories, environmental values, and economic objectives are almost in sync with the green marketing philosophy and environmental values, but since green products are perceived as premium category products, consumers’ buying decisions in favor of them was doubtful. The study also shed light on the future course to be adopted by the marketers in formulating sustainable green marketing strategies with the help of functional and emotional ‘green positioning.’ The review of studies suggested that the rise of ‘green brands’ in developing nations has begun. The paper’s uniqueness is that it summarized the works of some of the most prominent authors, and it also captured the classification of articles based on source, country, time, and theme.

However, social media research in B2B lacks a comprehensive overview from a strategic perspective, with most research to date having been focused on the tactical use of social media platforms, that is to say, in describing specific tools to implement a strategy. In the present systematic literature review we address this deficiency. Our findings reveal that prior B2B research predominately investigated social media as short-term tactics with context-specific limitations. Our thematic analysis extends beyond these boundaries and extracts from the literature three relationship-orientated themes in social media, namely their use as a tool for: 1) sales-facilitation, 2) integrated communication, and 3) employee engagement. These three themes are distinct yet interdependent and are each necessary if organizations are to develop a competitive advantage within the social media environment. The descriptive statistics and thematic analysis in the study present a set of five key findings that reflect the research gaps presently in the literature and thus highlight significant future research directions. The study also highlights the utility for organizations to employ social media in a strategic manner rather than simply as a tactical tool. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

Based on a literature search performed in July 2019 followed by a snowballing approach, 18 relevant articles were analyzed. Factors found to influence human-machine cognitive engagement were categorized into usage-related, agent-related, user-related, attitude and evaluation, and other factors. This study proposed a collective model of users' acceptance and use of {ICAs}, whereby user acceptance is driven mainly by usage benefits, which are influenced by agent and user characteristics.

Therefore, companies had to adopt different strategies to reach with their users, since traditional methods were no longer effective in some cases. It is the case of marketing, where companies had to change or blend traditional marketing with digital marketing (i.e., to promote their products and services through the internet). The aim of this work is to analyse the existing literature on similarities and differences between traditional and digital marketing. The methodologies used to achieve these objectives were a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis by Scopus.

However, research on the role of emotional intelligence specifically in the domain of human resource management in healthcare organizations has been ignored. This chapter compiles a comprehensive, systematic review of literature on the impacts of emotional intelligence in the healthcare sector spanning a period from 1960 to 2020. The authors aim to explore and raise pertinent questions about the impacts of emotional intelligence on healthcare outcomes, job stress, emotional labor, and linkages of emotional intelligence with a competitive advantage for healthcare organizations. A major contribution of this work is the proposal of a novel conceptual framework for the marketing of emotional intelligence in the healthcare sector. Literature gaps, relationships among works, and current trends are discussed. © 2021, {IGI} Global.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper reviews the literature on environmentally sustainable practices in textile, apparel and fashion ({TAF}) industries to allow the mapping of practices across various manufacturing processes and the development of a conceptual framework to guide investigation of the extent of sustainable practices in {TAF} industries from an environmental perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was undertaken, consisting of bibliometric and content analysis of 91 articles published in peer-reviewed journals over a 10-year period. Findings: The inclusion of sustainable practices from all manufacturing stages in this review illustrates the diversity and complexities of environmental practices in {TAF} contexts. However, there is less research in developing country contexts, where most {TAF} production takes place and a paucity of research in upstream stages of garment washing and dyeing, and the manufacture of trims, accessories and packaging. Research limitations/implications: The focus is on environmental sustainability and upstream manufacturing processes. The review includes literature in the form of academic journal articles from selected databases during the period January 2010–June 2020. Practical implications: This review provides academics with a unified depiction of environmentally sustainable practices to stimulate further scholarly research and provides guidance for managers to develop firm sustainability competency by summarising best practices at different manufacturing stages Originality/value: This review comprehensively maps the academic literature on environmentally sustainable practices in {TAF} industries from an upstream manufacturing operations context. It highlights the contribution of scholarly study to the knowledge base on environmentally sustainable practices in {TAF} industries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this sense, it is therefore incumbent to synthesize the stream of research on international marketing strategy with a particular focus on emerging-market exporting firms. Accordingly, the main purpose of this study is to critically assess the related empirical body of research, and to build a conceptual framework for further development by drawing on the knowledge gaps identified. Design/methodology/approach: To serve the research objective, this study adopts a systematic literature review methodology. In this sense, 51 articles were content-analyzed as to theoretical underpinnings, scope of research, research methodology, and empirical issues; and a comprehensive conceptual framework and research propositions were developed. Findings: The findings of this review delineate that the pertinent literature is characterized by some contextual, methodological, and empirical weaknesses. In a nutshell, although the last decades have witnessed a burgeoning interest; the pertinent literature is still at the introductory stage and needs additional improvement. Originality/value: By addressing the research gap concerning the requirement to synthesize and compile the empirical line of research on international marketing strategy of emerging-market exporting firms, this review study provides novel and valuable insights into the existing knowledge on the subject. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Performing dynamic {BSR} research is difficult, not only because of the requirements of data collection and analysis, but also due to the somewhat fragmented understanding of the available studies on {BSR} dynamics and how an overarching understanding of their findings can refine static relationship models. We conduct a systematic literature review to organize the available research on {BSR} dynamics. The review process reveals four overarching themes: (1) relationship continuity, (2) relationship learning, (3) relationship stages and trajectories, and (4) relationship fluctuations. We discuss each theme, describe how the themes can be applied as a dynamic lens to research questions involving {BSRs}, and outline research directions that might stimulate further work on relationship dynamics. © 2020, Academy of Marketing Science.},

In this context, we integrate the discourse on collaborative relationships in supply chains with stakeholder theory (roles and orientations) and use a multi-method approach combining systematic literature review ({SLR}) and embedded case studies based on secondary data. We develop a conceptual framework that illustrates collective stakeholder orientation emerging from aligned vertical and horizontal stakeholder orientation across the supply chain towards reducing {FLW}. We explain how achieving such alignment requires these stakeholders to navigate various collaboration conditions (structural and sporadic) that otherwise spur individualism, culminating in {FLW} mitigation efforts across food supply chains.

In the developed countries household food waste is a major concern, which is manly triggered by poor food-related behaviour. Due to the importance and magnitude of the phenomenon, the {UN} has set the global goal of halving food loss and waste by 2030. However, to the best of our knowledge, to date no systematic literature review has been conducted on household food waste and little comprehensive explanation has yet been offered for wasteful household behaviour. Therefore, the aim of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the literature produced over an eighteen-year period (2000–2018) in order to gain a deeper understanding of multiple, complex facets of the food waste phenomenon at consumer level. Drawing on the results of the systematic literature review and of the behavioural and marketing theories, we propose a new theoretical framework “The Household Wasteful Behaviour Framework”, with the aim of better explaining food waste behaviour at household level. Results can be useful to better target social norm and educational campaigns both at private and public level. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

From a methodological standpoint, we first conducted a systematic literature review on brand extension to identify relevant determinants. Subsequently, we quantitatively evaluated the influence of the selected determinants on brand extension success in a fit scenario and a non-fit scenario using {PLS}-{SEM} study with 350 participants. We observed, regardless of fit, that consumer-specific factors such as consumer innovativeness and category involvement are of higher relevance for the intention to adopt a brand extension than brand-specific factors like brand equity or brand commitment. In contrast, brand-specific factors are only of significant impact in the non-fit scenario. Management practice should see the brand-specific factors as the starting point for measures to reinforce brand extension success. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

This pool of multi-disciplinary studies has yielded fragmented literature resulting in ambiguity. Therefore there is a need for an article, which studies the extant literature comprehensively. Hence, this paper aims to pursue two objectives, to summarize prominent research studies in consumption narratives and to suggest directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews 25 key studies on consumption narratives and highlights their most important contributions, methods and findings. Findings: As in consumer narrative research, the concept almost always has been borrowed from different domains, the findings suggest a concise definition to fill this gap. Also, to enrich the findings, three-level of consumption narratives are discussed. Originality/value: This paper serves as a basis to comprehend the essence of consumption narratives in the consumption context, to understand the research gaps and provides directions for future research. © 2021, Emad Rahmanian.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Big data is one of the most demanding topics in contemporary marketing research. Despite its importance, the big data-based strategic orientation in international marketing is yet to be formed conceptually. Thus, the purpose of this study is to systematically review and propose a holistic framework on big data-based strategic orientation for firms in international markets to attain a sustained firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a systematic literature review to synthesize research rigorously. Initially, 2,242 articles were identified from the selective databases, and 45 papers were finally reported as most relevant to propose an integrative conceptual framework. Findings: The findings of the systematic literature review revealed data-evolving, and data-driven strategic orientations are essential for performing international marketing activities that contain three primary orientations such as (1) international digital platform orientation, (2) international market orientation and (3) international innovation and entrepreneurial orientation. Eleven distinct sub-dimensions reflect these three primary orientations. These strategic orientations of international firms may lead to advanced analytics orientation to attain sustained firm performance by generating and capturing value from the marketplace. Research limitations/implications: The study minimizes the literature gap by forming knowledge on big data-based strategic orientation and framing a multidimensional framework for guiding managers in the context of strategic orientation for international business and international marketing activities. The current study was conducted by following only a systematic literature review exclusively in firms' overall big data-based strategic orientation concept in international marketing. Future research may extend the domain by introducing firms' category wise systematic literature review. Originality/value: The study has proposed a holistic conceptual framework for big data-driven strategic orientation in international marketing literature through a systematic review for the first time. It has also illuminated a future research agenda that raises questions for the scholars to develop or extend theory in this area or other related disciplines. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study, a systematic review, focuses on the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises ({SMEs}) originating in developing countries. It critically analyses, evaluates and synthesises studies featuring formal and informal institutions, embedded in social and business networks, as a marketing solution for institutional voids. The review shows that current international marketing studies downplay the role of informal institutions in the internationalisation of {SMEs}. Thus, the authors set a new research agenda for advancing the institutional theory to account for the impact of informal institutions and networks on firm internationalisation. Design/methodology/approach: This review followed five structured stages, including framing the research questions, identifying relevant studies, assessing their quality, summarising the evidence and interpreting the findings. Based on the systematic approach, 434 papers (374 from Web of Science, 60 from Scopus) were generated. Following that, the authors applied the qualitative inclusion/exclusion criteria, which yielded 63 papers. Their analysis involved three authors, with the fourth author focusing on ensuring quality in the analysis. Findings: The study findings invite a different line of theorising market structures and processes focusing on the role of networks as an alternative to formal institutional systems. The outcome of our review suggests that there is scope for developing the institutional theory that account for the role of informal institutions and networks. Originality/value: Based on the analysis, we call for new theorisation, in the international marketing literature, which accounts for informal networking amongst internationalising {SMEs} in the light of institutional voids. Thus, the authors promote novel participatory, bottom to top understanding of relationship between institutions and enterprises. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study aims to address those gaps and determine a strategic direction for future research by providing an in-depth systematic literature review of existing material on athlete branding. A total of 63 articles published in 27 academic journals between 1999 and 2019 were analysed, revealing research on athlete branding had predominantly focused on brand image from the consumer perspective. Few studies investigated strategic athlete brand building and the importance of brand identity creation from the brand manager (athlete) perspective. Study findings highlight the importance of brand congruence as the synergy between athlete brand identity and athlete brand image. This research establishes foundations to inform development of strategic direction, guide future research and be the catalyst for new and innovative projects around athlete brand management.

The purpose of this paper is to identify {GS} diffusion drivers in the precision medicine ({PM}) ecosystem. Design/methodology/approach: After reviewing the literature on innovation diffusion, particularly on {GS} diffusion, the {PM} ecosystem actors are interviewed to obtain their perspective. Using content analysis, the interviewees’ visions were interplayed with the literature to achieve driver conceptualization, which posteriorly originated broad themes. Findings: The results indicate that {GS} diffusion depends on satisfying aspects from three broad themes and respective drivers: technology (evidence strength and credibility, customization, knowledge, data and information, tech evolution speed and cost), human (ethics, privacy and security and user power) and business (prevention, holistic view of the individual, public policy and regulation, business model and management). Practical implications: The main management implications refer to considering health care in a multidisciplinary way, investing in the propagation of genetic knowledge, standardizing medical records and interpreting data. Originality/value: This study, to the best of authors’ knowledge, is the first attempt to understand {GS} diffusion from a broad perspective, taking into account the {PM} stakeholders’ view. The 13 drivers offer a comprehensive understanding of how {GS} could spread in health care and they can assist researchers and practitioners to discuss and set strategies based on an initial structured map. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The concept of social capital advocates that the goodwill available from relations is a valuable resource that can facilitate collective actions. Although social capital has recently gained momentum in the buyer-supplier relationship ({BSR}) literature, there is a surprising lack of consensus about its antecedents, benefits, risks, and boundary conditions in such relationships. To address this void, a systematic literature review of seventy articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2002 and 2018 was undertaken. The review identified and discusses two types of antecedents that can give rise to social capital in {BSRs}, namely intrafirm-level and relationship-level antecedents (i.e., structural and relational). It reveals that social capital can lead to a variety of benefits, in the form of direct performance improvements (e.g., operational) and relationship benefits (e.g., knowledge sharing), however that these benefits may vary depending on a number of boundary conditions in {BSRs} (e.g., contract specificity). The review also highlights that although social capital can generate benefits, it can also lead to risks that can undermine the performance and evolution of {BSRs} (e.g., reduced exploratory learning), suggesting a ‘double-edged sword’ effect. The paper concludes by summarizing current research gaps and outlining promising directions for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Despite rising academic interest, the non-adoption of digital innovation or consumer resistance has received less scholarly attention as compared to the factors driving the adoption of digital products and services. The existing research on consumer resistance is also in siloes, running across multiple verticals, spanning from resistance to green products to the Internet of things ({IoT}). The current study provides a systematic review of the extant literature on consumer resistance to digital innovations by utilising the systematic literature review ({SLR}) methodology. A total of 54 studies were selected for content analysis to isolate thematic foci, identify research gaps, recommend future research avenues and develop a framework. Our analysis revealed that the extant literature could be grouped under broad research themes, namely resistance to digital innovations, organisational resistance to technological innovations, resistance to technological healthcare innovations and consumer resistance to innovations (offline). The results of this {SLR} study are expected to galvanise future research in this area from the theoretical as well as from a practice-oriented perspective by providing various actionable inputs to combat consumer resistance to digital innovations. © 2020},

Behavioral reasoning theory ({BRT}) is a relatively new theory that determines the linkage between beliefs, reasons, motives, intentions, and behavior. This study conducts a systematic literature review ({SLR}) to synthesize the existing body of knowledge around {BRT}. The present {SLR} critically examines the origin of this theory and its linkages with other behavioral theories, thus providing insightful knowledge on its foundations. Further, it presents the state-of-the-art research knowledge, research themes, implications, and future directions related to {BRT} literature. Our analysis shows that the reasons for and reasons against construct plays an important role in predicting consumer behavior. This study also finds that research related to {BRT} is growing rapidly and needs methodological advancements. These findings will enable scholars and practitioners to better understand how {BRT} works, what its strengths and potential are, the contexts in which it has been utilized, its existing limitations, and the sort of methodological advancements needed in future studies on marketing. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Purpose: Product lifecycle management ({PLM}) is an enterprise-wide strategy gaining prominence across manufacturing. The fashion industry is a late adopter of {PLM}, yet within global fashion and textile organisations {PLM} is now becoming a mainstream approach to optimize core processes. This literature review analyses the latest academic research to establish a broad basis of understanding of {PLM} in the sector and identify potential future research directions. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the current state and main perspectives of research on {PLM} in the textiles and apparel sector. The paper adopts the three features (managerial, technological and collaborative) of the definition of {PLM} by Corallo et al. (2013) as the analytic framework for the 27 papers to illustrate how {PLM} is framed and conceptualised in the {RFA} sector. Findings: {PLM} is at an interesting phase as it evolves from classical {PLM} 1.0 to connected {PLM} 2.0. The evolution of {PLM} from its {PDM} origins as an {IT} tool to a critical component of the strategy for digital transformation is reported. The strategic role of suppliers is noted as a critical success factor. Key inhibitors relating to {PLM} adoption and optimization in the sector are identified as limited holistic and theoretical perspective of {PLM} coupled with a deficiency in relevant industry skills. It is argued that the transformational potential of {PLM} 2.0 may not be fully realised without a more coordinated development effort through industrial and academic collaboration. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this study are that it is a literature review of academic papers in the {RFA} sector papers within the timescale 2000–2018. {PLM} 1.0 has dominated in this time period however the potential trajectory of connected {PLM} 2.0 is beginning to emerge. Practical implications: The results from this paper indicate that there is a lack of research on {PLM} in the sector and concludes by suggesting promising future research possibilities: further empirical and case studies on organisations implementing a {PLM} strategy; studies reporting on the contribution of {PLM} to address the challenges of sustainability, traceability and transparency in the industry and inter-industry collaborations; studies with knowledge management theories specifically applied to the textile and apparel sector; and the opportunity for academic and industry collaboration on the development of {PLM} to meet these needs. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, no systematic literature review on this topic has previously been published in academic journals. Given levels of investment in {PLM} platforms in the sector, both practitioners in companies and the academic community might find the review and agenda for future research useful. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to systematically review the existing literature on Islamic marketing and its major impacts on consumer behaviours. In addition, this study seeks to shed light on global trends and dynamics beyond Islamic marketing and how Islam, as one of the most prominent religions worldwide, affects the consumption and purchasing choices of Muslim consumers. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of published peer-reviewed articles on Islamic marketing was conducted. A comprehensive search strategy was applied on different databases, including Google Scholar, {JSTOR}, {ScienceDirect}, {MUSE} and Directory of Open Access Journals, and the retrieved articles were then selected from 14 leading journals published between 2010 and 2018. Findings: Islam as a religion has been found to impact the ethical beliefs and behaviours of Muslim consumers from different countries, as well as consumers’ choice of services and some taboo products on the basis of Islamic Shariah law. The results show that Islamic marketing has a significant impact on the characteristics of Muslim consumers and therefore affects their key choices about certain products and services. Research limitations/implications: The studies included in this review are extensively based on peer-reviewed articles published in high-ranked marketing journals (A* and A in the Australian Business Deans Council list), which may be perceived as a limitation in the present study. Another limitation is that this study only took into account peer-reviewed articles written in English. Practical implications: The important relationship between Islam and the heterogeneous Muslim consumer will have a considerable practical implication for companies that explore the marketing supply capacity in the Islamic world. The authors hereby expect the current review to significantly impact the identification of methodologies for the main trends in the academic analysis of Islamic marketing and Islamic consumer behaviour. Originality/value: This review provides a strong contribution to Islamic marketing literature by recommending the need to integrate the Islamic practices related to consumer consumption of goods and services in studies focused on consumer behaviour analysis. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Recycling behavior research is receiving extensive attention from various disciplines because of the increasing prioritization of resource recovery and management by policymakers and industry. This article provides a clear view of the progression of publications and research diversification within the domain. The 788 articles which focused on consumers’ or households’ recycling behavior were analyzed using software. Resources, Conservation and Recycling was the top contributing journal, and Stewart Barr was the top contributing author. With the help of citation analysis and bibliographic coupling, the intellectual structure of recycling behavior research was obtained, showing that the research had diversified into seven identifiable clusters. The research in the area was initially focused on environmental behaviors and their determinants, household recycling behavior and behavioral theories like the Theory of Planned Behavior. Other focus areas that aid in research progression were spillover effects, past behavior, habits and behavior change. These clusters further provided the base for research on recycling behavior toward specific product categories. The content analysis of the lead papers in each cluster further helps in disclosing the foundations of and future directions of research. © 2020 Taylor \& Francis Group, {LLC}.},

	abstract = {Purpose: When fighting the burden of overweight and obesity, diet remains a powerful preventive factor. The purpose of this paper is to stimulate more efficient interventions on diet change by synthesising knowledge of previous weight loss programmes based on the use of digital devices. Design/methodology/approach: Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses approach, a systematic literature review through five databases was undertaken focussed on the assessment of studies oriented towards diet change that incorporated digital devices including computers, tablets, mobile phones, portable and non-portable tracking devices. In total, 15 empirical studies (2004–2018) were identified and examined for efficacy and presence of theory and behaviour change techniques. Findings: Digital devices supporting weight loss programmes have evolved rapidly over the past 15 years, from reminders using the short message system to self-quantification through mobile applications. Nine studies show a significant difference between conditions, in favour or one (or more) intervention arm. The remaining studies failed to find significance between conditions but were using a comparison with an active intervention, potentially indicating equivalent efficacy. A low level of theory use and use of behavioural techniques was evident. Research limitations/implications: The literature review is limited to studies that have scientifically evaluated the (potential) weight loss associated with the weight loss intervention. This review could be put into perspective with other complementary research, in particular, qualitative research aimed at exploring participants’ motivations to use (or not) digital devices to lose weight. Social implications: Given their low cost and the size of the overweight population, it appears that public health policies could integrate digital devices more strongly in their efforts to combat obesity. Social marketing can add its expertise to medical-based programmes which in return bring their need for more quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of the interventions. Originality/value: Few previous reviews have examined the extent of the efficiency in digital diet change programmes. The review shows that, in general, digital interventions can support weight loss for adults; however, more studies are required to provide a strong evidence base for efficacy. Given their low cost and the size of the overweight population, public health policies could integrate these devices more strongly in their efforts to combat obesity. A theory-driven social marketing perspective could enhance development ensuring interventions are effective and valued by users. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The paper aims to characterise the phenomenon of ‘digital servitization’ by examining how the literature describes the convergence between servitization and digital technologies as well as to identify areas for future research developments. The systematic review of the available scientific literature revealed limited but rapidly growing coverage of the phenomenon by scientific studies, which have mainly focused on the role of a few digital technologies (above all, the Internet of Things), studied in isolation. The research has mainly adopted an empirical, case-based methodological approach, mostly investigating the industrial equipment, automotive, and {IT} industries and focusing on the role of digital technologies for the implementation of intermediate and advanced services.

In addition to serious market distortions, there are increasingly digital challenges and investments in the banks' platforms to remain competitive and continue to meet customer requirements. Other industries are showing the banks how to do it and investing heavily in the networking of distribution channels to form an omni-channel system, as this is where all interfaces converge. The banking industry has also recognized this groundbreaking approach in the distribution channel. Academic literature is also increasingly examining omni-channel management, but studies in the banking industry are still sparse. This study uses multi-method research in the form of a systematic literature review and semi-structured qualitative bank expert interviews to examine omni-channel management in the banking industry. Thereby, the state of scientific research and the future objectives of the banks are analyzed. Bank experts in Germany explain what bank customers will expect, how far German banks have progressed in implementing an omni-channel system, and how the bank-customer relationship will change. Findings show that banks will completely transform their distribution by omni-channel management by breaking with existing structures and creating a new customer experience and higher customer value. The paper provides critical insight into what omni-channel integration means for the banking sector. © Michael Menrad, 2020.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to provide a review of the extant literature on value creation and destruction in social marketing services for social change, for the purposes of developing a research agenda for future research in this area. Creating value in social marketing services is now identified as a key focus for social marketing (Russell-Bennett et al., 2009; Domegan et al., 2013), yet work in this area is nascent and conceptual, methodological, and empirical work is needed to advance the research agenda (Zainuddin et al., 2013; 2016). Design/methodology/approach: To help shape the future of research on value in social marketing services, this paper appraises the contributions of the current research literature, and identifies gaps in the current knowledge. A systematic literature review was conducted, following the {PRISMA} protocol for conducting and reporting systematic reviews (Moher et al., 2009). The review covers the areas of value creation in social marketing, value destruction in social marketing, dimensions of value in social marketing, and from value-in-exchange, to value-in-use, to value-in-behaviour in social change. Findings: A research agenda for further work in this area is provided within the themes of 1. conceptual development, 2. broadening ontological, epistemological, and methodological foundations, 3. research contexts, and 4. measuring and evaluating value in social marketing services. Within each of these themes, a series of research questions are provided to guide further work in the four identified themes. Originality/value: This paper is the first to offer a review of the extant literature on value creation and destruction in social marketing and social marketing services, and offer a research agenda for future work in this area. This paper contributes to services marketing and the development of service thinking as key component of social marketing, and the role that value creation plays in this (Russell-Bennett et al., 2013). © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the development of service ecosystems literature and its four premises as follows: the characterization of service ecosystems as loosely coupled systems, the existence of shared institutional arrangements among actors, the occurrence of resource-integrating interactions among actors and value co-creation as the stated purpose of service ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: With a systematic literature review, the paper identifies and analyzes 98 articles on service ecosystems. An examination and a cross-check of the central elements of the articles reveal gaps and limitations in the analysis of service ecosystems. These results lead to the formulation of four propositions and suggestions for further research. Findings: The four premises of service ecosystems are constrained by overly optimistic perceptions that prevent theoretical advancements. These premises overlook possible tight coupling; power asymmetries; divergent interpretations of institutions and institutional arrangements; divergent interpretations of actors’ resource-integrating actions, intentions and abilities; and the co-destruction of value. Four propositions are formulated to address these challenges. Research limitations/implications: The shortcomings reflect the systematic literature review, which only covers a specific area of the extant knowledge base, namely, English-language articles published in peer-reviewed international journals. Originality/value: This study extensively and critically investigates the premises of service ecosystems for the first time, proposing a more holistic, dynamic and realistic understanding of them. In so doing, it paves the way for renewed conceptualizations of service ecosystems. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to analyze the available literature on the use of digital marketing in a business-to-business (B2B) context. It identifies gaps in the current research knowledge and proposes a research agenda for scholars and practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review has been conducted on B2B digital marketing. The various themes have been identified on the basis of the comprehensive analysis of extant literature. Also, semi-structured interviews with B2B marketing experts were also conducted to further refine the emerged digital marketing themes. Findings: Although some B2B firms use digital marketing, most are unable to leverage its full benefits because of the dearth of comprehensive research on the subject. This review provides an insight into the emerging themes by developing a collaborative conceptual framework. The review highlights that few areas such as digital marketing communication and sales management have witnessed steady development while decision support systems, critical success factors, electronic marketing orientation ({EMO}), etc., were lesser explored. Furthermore, it identifies research gaps and highlights the emerging research themes for future researchers. Practical implications: The collaborative framework will help organizations to align their digital marketing activities as per the changing market dynamics such as the focus on building social media capability, {EMO} and value co-creation. Originality/value: Research on the use of digital marketing by B2B firms is still at the embryonic stage. This study is a pioneering effort to review the use of digital marketing in B2B organizations and identify research priorities for scholars and practitioners. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We adopted a systematic literature review as research method. We used the {ISI} web of Knowledge database to collect data, and after the selection process, 36 papers were identified and analyzed. Through the analysis of the results, we perceived that this is a recent topic addressed in the literature, with this review identifying the first research in 1995. Another conclusion is that most studies are of the empirical-quantitative type. Of the three decades analyzed in this study, the last decade (2011–2019) was the one in which the largest number of publications was registered.

	doi = {10.1108/JIMA-09-2018-0163},
	abstract = {Purpose: In view of increasing demand of halal foods and to properly address the needs of various types of consumers, the literary inquiries have sprung in this area since start of twenty-first century. However, the number of papers published in reputed journals is still pegged to the lowest ebb. This paper aims to systematically review all qualitative research papers, published in reputed journals, and to give specific directions to future researchers to move on and explore some other required areas. Design/methodology/approach: The Campbell collaboration systematic literature review technique was adopted as methodology to screen out relevant studies. A total of 11 qualitative studies qualified the set criteria which have used various qualitative methodologies like interviews, focus groups, observations and netnography. The qualitative data were analyzed through {nVivo} software by adopting Spiggle’s steps of data analysis. Findings: In these selected qualitative studies, around 24 main themes were extracted in total, out of which four themes were repeatedly discussed in most of these studies. Likewise, the details of geographical location of authors, type of methodology used, religious affiliation of respondents, type of journals, most prolific journals and citations of each paper were worked out and given in the form of result tables. Based on the importance of this fastest-growing global food market, it has been concluded that the qualitative research inquiries are still in infancy in this area, and more papers need to be published in reputed journals. Research limitations/implications: As per set criteria, only papers published in quality journals were included in this review; therefore, the main limitation of this review is that it has not included other qualitative papers published elsewhere. Practical implications: The future researchers can use the results of this study in setting direction of their research in the area of halal food consumption. These results can be used by academicians to know about the extent of research conducted in this area, whereas marketers can make prudent policies based on these explored areas. Originality/value: It is claimed to be the first systematic literature review on halal food consumption. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a systematic literature review approach. The review is based on 25 systematically selected publications published from 2000 to 2018 and retrieved from bibliographic databases and through a process of snowballing. Findings: The authors found several alternative conceptualizations of a {BM} at a network level, which highlighted different elements as core components. Based on this, authors’ findings suggest the literature has a fragmented view of what the {BM} concept entails at a network level, and of which actors are relevant. Conversely, there is a consensus that a single-firm view is inadequate for describing and studying joint value architectures because of its inability to consider all involved actors and their activities and resources. Therefore, a network-oriented view, as a relational aggregator, is seen as a possible way forward. Originality/value: The study contributes to the current understanding of a {BM} concept at a network level and suggests three viewpoints from which to interpret value architectures at different levels of analysis: single-firm view, dyadic-level view and network-oriented view. Furthermore, the authors highlight several gaps to be studied and provide avenues for future research opportunities for scholars. © 2020, Milan Jocevski, Niklas Arvidsson and Antonio Ghezzi.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review of the research published on financial inclusion ({FI}) and financial exclusion ({FE}) in developed countries using key terms and strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 52 papers were deemed to be relevant to the analysis. These works were critiqued using a framework that addressed geographical contexts, topics, methodologies and theoretical frameworks. Findings: This review highlights the uneven level of development of the academic debate between North America, the {UK} and continental Europe, and identifies the different theoretical frameworks that construe the body of literature in each region. In addition, the findings show the scant offer of work on the impact that the digital economy has on {FE}, as well as the reduced number of studies which have focused on certain vulnerable groups and the access to some financial services. Social implications: The studies reviewed have not analyzed the specific needs of vulnerable groups while considering the different contexts and pathways to exclusion. The evaluation of solutions and strategies to achieve inclusion is one of the least addressed aspects in the literature. Originality/value: The paper synthesizes the main contributions of the top literature on the redefinition of {FI}/{FE} in developed countries, the role of fringe services and new determinants of exclusion. The proliferation of studies regarding {FI} in low- and middle-income countries has generated a great amount of meta-analysis and systematized reviews of asymmetric results. However, no systematized literature review on the broad scope of {FI}/{FE} in developed countries has been published in the last decade.

First, it posits that any action research project needs to consider the four elements of problem identification, theorization, creating guiding concepts and intervention. Second, based on these elements mirrored in service action research, it outlines and analyzes three approaches to action research (i.e. theory-enhancing, concept developing and practice-enhancing).

However, actionable guidelines for customer participation management ({CPM})—i.e., organizational actions and activities that aim to affect customers’ contribution to service production and delivery—are currently lacking (Mustak et al. 2016). To fill this research gap, a fruitful approach is to take a human resource management ({HRM}) perspective on {CPM} (Mustak et al. 2016). The rationale is that, in a {CP} context, customers can be considered “partial employees” of the organization (Groth 2005; Xie et al. 2008) and “serve as critical human resources that must be managed so that their efforts are in line with the goals and strategy of the firm” (Halbesleben and Buckley 2004, p. 356). Groth (2005) emphasized the value of extending {HRM} theories to {CPM} and called for more research on this topic to create a more actionable understanding of {CPM}. However, more than 10 years later, a systematic literature review conducted by Mustak et al. (2016) revealed that prior studies on {CPM} offer little actionable knowledge: “Most of these studies do not discuss specific managerial tools or methods that can be applied in real life situations” (Mustak et al. 2016, p. 263). As a result, they call for research that is more directly applicable to managers since there is a clear need to translate theoretical knowledge into actionable guidelines. In light of this research call, this paper extends Psychological Capital ({PsyCap}) from {HRM} to {CPM}. Specifically, we investigate the value of customers’ {PsyCap} as a manageable driver of {CP}. {PsyCap} involves an individual’s positive assessment of circumstances and probability for success, and prior {HRM} studies offer several actionable guidelines for developing {PsyCap}. Most of these guidelines can be translated to a {CP} setting which allows the design of truly actionable strategies for {CPM}. Study 1 demonstrates the predictive value of {PsyCap} as a key driver of {CP} by examining its relative impact on {CP} attitude and intention compared to alternative {CP} drivers (role clarity, extrinsic benefits, intrinsic benefits). Furthermore, this study reveals the impact of several task-related antecedents (compatibility, observability, trialability, complexity, and perceived risk) on these {CP} drivers. Study 2 demonstrates the managerial value of {PsyCap} by translating existing guidelines for developing {PsyCap} from the employee to the customer domain and revealing boundary conditions for {PsyCap} development. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.},

	abstract = {Virtual trade show ({VTS}) marketing has been growing as a major issue of interest from the last decade, attracting the businessperson and researcher. However, this body of research has not been subject to systematic review. Accordingly, the purpose of the study is to highlight past assessment, present trends, and to direct future research agenda within the {VTS} domain. The approach is taken as a literature review format. For this purpose, multiple databases were searched, and ten {VTS} articles were extracted. The extracted articles were carefully analyzed from the broader perspective, and only four empirical studies were found in this field. The paper was aggregated into the following themes: (1) preliminary discussion on {VTS} and comparison with physical trade show based on participation mode; activity stage; subject area; and performance and (2) from the empirical findings, three categories of antecedents are identified, namely, website factors; market-orientation factors; and firms’ motives. Also, direct as well as indirect consequences through mediators and with moderators are identified. All these are presented as an integrated framework. (3) Based on the compendium of the antecedents and consequences of {VTS} literature, the research focused on the limitations, implications, and extends future research avenue that can be utilized by trade show attending firms for their better performance in the future. The findings suggest that future {VTS} research can exploit from the application of concepts and theories used in the physical trade show literature and offered by other disciplines that traditionally have not been examined in {VTS}. Future researchers could also focus on the development of a technological aspect of {VTS} systems to overcome the limitation of unavailability of modern technology, low-quality website design, lack of timeliness and accuracy of information content, inability to measure effectiveness, virtual rudeness, lack of after service initiative, and lack of synergies between human and electronic elements. Managers of {VTS} firm can identify the important technologies related to {VTS} on different stages (preshow, at-show, and post–post) and can imply a convenient way to establish human interaction along with technological issues. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.},

	abstract = {Customer experience ({CE}) is the essence of what constitutes the interaction of a service and a customer. It is multidimensional and comprised of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, sensorial, and social elements resulting from a direct or indirect interaction with a firm (Lemon and Verhoef 2016, p. 71). {CE} has many definitions and descriptions of its constituent elements, which adds a layer of complexity in constructing comparable studies across the board. This fragmentation poses limitations for new researchers who attempt to study {CE}, described as “widely used, and abused”, and at the risk of being “dismissed because of the ambiguous manner in which it has been applied” (Palmer 2010, p. 196). To this extent, the aim of this work is to (i) explore the definitions of {CE} and its elements, (ii) analyze conceptual and empirical studies relating to these elements, and (iii) from the previous two objectives incorporate a bottom-up approach, producing a unified elemental mapping framework enabling a more integrated and holistic manner in which {CE} is studied and observed in both academia and practice. Following the objectives for this work, we conduct a systematic literature review ({SLR}) search pertaining to {CE} and its elements, analyzing the different conceptualizations of its meaning and empirical foundations. We then extract and semantically group the {CE} elements into a unified list. After reviewing and analyzing our results we note that the literature defines {CE} through socioeconomic, phenomenological, or a combination of these lenses. Furthermore, we observe that these lenses are driven along service and customer centric perspectives. We build upon the inductive experiential mapping scheme used by Lofman (1991) to build a sub-elemental framework from the unified {CE} element list we obtained. From a theoretical standpoint, we attempt to redefine {CE} from the extant {SLR}. Additionally, we propose a sub-elemental mapping framework which would alleviate some of the conceptual fragmentation we highlighted in studying {CE}. From a managerial standpoint, we aim at addressing {CE} managers and executives by providing them with a theoretically-driven framework enabling them to map their organizational {CE}. As a result, a standardized means to measure and better understand {CE} in practice could be achieved. As a way forward, our mapping framework could provide a starting point to potentially connect technology-driven methods using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to for example, utilize text-mining, and heuristic internet of things to map experiential data. This would enable researchers and managers to conduct studies in different contexts and domains, providing a customer-centric approach to {CE} while subsequently contributing to our holistic understanding of this concept. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The concept of emotional labor refers to the management of emotions in interaction with customers. This study aims to suggest an integrative definition of emotional labor. It develops a conceptual framework that helps organize and synthesize key insights from the literature, in an interactional and multi-level perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This integrated framework consists in a mapping of key research themes resulting from a systematic literature review, which includes research in sales and marketing. As critical affective processes in sales have not been studied sufficiently, both in business-to-business and business-to-customer selling, this review also incorporates works in other research fields. Findings: Sales representatives’ emotional labor must be considered as a bi-directional interaction with the customer in a multi-level perspective. Moreover, emotional labor has rather negative consequences for the salesperson (e.g. burnout and job stress), but may have positive sales and customer outcomes. Findings suggest that the expression of genuine emotions should be used during sales interactions. In addition, organizations should prevent customers’ negative behaviors (e.g. mistreatment). Practical implications: Emotional labor key practical implications with regard to several management functions such as the recruitment, performance management and training (Ashkanasy and Daus, 2002) of the sales representatives. Originality/value: Research on emotional labor in a sales ecosystem is scarce. It has largely covered service industry employees in contact with customers, but has not paid enough attention to sales representatives (Mikeska et al., 2015). The proposed integrated framework concerning emotional labor focuses on the bi-directional interaction between the sales representatives and their customers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Objective: This research seeks to reveal the real interest of the marketing researchers by the geomarketing issue, and to show how methodological aspects (implications of locational methods) and theoretical (conceptual differences) act in the stagnation and the low participation of the scientific production of studies of geomarketing. Method: Data collection through a questionnaire, systematic literature review, and demographic database, treated by statistical (t-test/regression) and locational methods. Main results: Marketing researchers' interests for the locational issue are not reflected in scientific production volume. Few researchers of locational methods explore the implications of those methods on the marketing problem results. Using Geographic Information Systems ({GIS}) and the theoretical linkage of research to the seminal structure of marketing (regional school) are elements that make geomarketing research difficult, and as possible justifications for the low representativeness of geomarketing in the areas of business (administration and marketing). Theoretical/Methodological Contributions: Locational methods can be reproduced without the use of {GIS}. The implications associated with locational methods can be used as solution drivers for each research problem. The problems of geomarketing can be linked to the theory of marketing, provided that the place presents itself as an element of connection with the market and its dynamics, and not as disconnected object of consumer behavior. Originality/Relevance: The research shows how to avoid the inconsistent application of techniques, concepts, and geographical labels in the various empirical domains of regional marketing, a relevant point to increase the number of geomarketing researches by marketing researchers, in developing countries such as Brazil. © 2020 Universidade Nove de Julho-{UNINOVE}.},

	abstract = {Servitization describes the addition of services to manufacturers' core product offerings to create additional customer value. This study aims to identify the key themes and research priorities in this body of literature over thirteen years from 2005 and 2017, based on four major research streams (general management, marketing, operations, and service management). Prior multi-theme literature reviews have focused on operations journals, overlooking important work in other streams, particularly marketing. Informed by a systematic literature review of 219 papers, the study identifies five main themes: service offerings; strategy and structure; motivations and performance; resources and capabilities; service development, sales, and delivery. Within each theme, gaps in the literature are identified and eleven research priorities presented. The review shows that the literature has evolved significantly in recent years, becoming increasingly diverse. A recent noteworthy topic is the use of digital technologies, which indicates the increasing relevance of technological developments to manufacturers' service activities. Our review highlights that there are still some fundamental aspects of servitization that warrant further research, primarily the need to replace the focal-manufacturer perspective with a multi-actor perspective that highlights the important role of relationships with existing and potentially new actors as a result of technological developments. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore the current state of research on supply chain flexibility ({SCF}) and mass personalization ({MP}) to identify the literature findings to date, research gaps and to provide guidelines for future research in this area. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of 64 papers was undertaken to address the use of {SCF} as a productive response to {MP} environments. The methodology used is made up of five steps: formulation of the research questions, identification of studies, selection and evaluation of studies, analysis and synthesis and presentation of the results. Findings: Three main research topics have been identified: personalization levels and flexible processes in supply chain, where flexible processes in supply chain are analysed as a productive response to high levels of {MP}; supply chain collaborative processes for {SCF} and {MP}, where product co-creation and relationships between supply chain members is analysed; and {SCF} and {MP} enabling technologies, in which technologies to support {MP} implementation and {SCF} are considered. Each of these three main topics have been divided into research lines and research sublines that allowed identifying a positive relationship between the {SCF} and the {MP} strategies. Research limitations/implications: Systematic literature review is a methodology reliable and recommended by a large number of scientific papers. However, it depends on available and accessible research studies and the researcher’s criteria. The selection of certain criteria for inclusion and exclusion of papers introduces publication bias, which should be considered an intrinsic limitation to systematic literature review. Originality/value: The main literature findings in each research line and subline related to the {SCF}-{MP} relationship are identified and analysed. Furthermore, research gaps and further research lines in the {SCF}-{MP} area are highlighted. The information presented in this paper improves the literature on the advances in the {SCF} use as a productive response to {MP} environments. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Food waste is a systemic problem, with waste occurring at all stages in the supply chain and consumption process. There is a need to unpack which strategies, approaches and tools can be applied to reduce the amount of food wasted. Understanding the extent of social marketing principles used offers insights into the additional means that can be applied to increase voluntary behavioral change. Design/methodology/approach: Following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, a systematic quantitative literature review was undertaken focused on outcome evaluation studies conducted since 2000. Six databases were examined, and cross rating was used to identify previous programs tackling food waste behavior at a household level. A total of 23 programs were analyzed against 8 social marketing components. Findings: Overall, only 2 out of 23 food waste programs self-identified as social marketing programs. A lack of application of social marketing elements was observed across all studies, indicating a tendency to implement non-voluntary change approaches. The most commonly targeted behaviors were source-separation. Personal interaction involved the distribution of information in person (typically through door knocking). Personal interaction strategies were identified as the most effective program techniques. Program effectiveness was greater when the social marketing components of behavioral change, theory and marketing mix were used, indicating the potential for voluntary approaches to be applied more in the future. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study was the first systematic literature review to examine the extent of social marketing application in food waste programs reported in peer-reviewed academic literature using eight components of social marketing. The study revealed behavioral change was more likely when more social marketing components were used. Future research is recommended to consider the application of full range of social marketing elements to extend beyond involuntary approaches, which can be subjected to criticism from community. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: In total, 143 research papers were reviewed during 1996-2017. A critical review was carried out in various dimensions such as research methodologies/data collection method (empirical, case study and literature review) and inquiry mode of research methodology (qualitative, quantitative and mixed), country-specific, targeted area, research aim and year of publication. Findings: Supply chain ({SC}) operations, performance measurement, inventory management, lean and agile operation, and use of information technology were well studied and analyzed, however, employee and customer training, tracking and visibility of medicines, cold chain management, human resource practices, risk management and waste management are felt to be important areas but not much attention were made in this direction. Research limitations/implications: Mainly drug and vaccine {SC} were considered in current study of {HSC} while {SC} along healthcare equipment and machine, hospitality and drug manufacturing related papers were excluded in this study. Practical implications: This literature review has recognized and analyzed various issues relevant to {HSC} and shows the direction for future research to develop an efficient and effective {HSC}. Originality/value: The insight of various aspects of {HSC} was explored in general for better and deeper understanding of it for designing of an efficient and competent {HSC}.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper addresses to the research gap on the role played by a brand in creating value for business customers through the adoption of reverse channels by presenting a research agenda in the form of a conceptual framework. The research agenda discussed in this paper is based on the argument that a brand provides an assurance of the quality and functional capability of the products to new users of old products, delivers rational benefits to business customers, and strengthens the customer base of manufacturers. Methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted to develop propositions to develop deep insights into the role of a brand in creating value for business customers through the adoption of reverse channels. Findings: Based on an extensive review of the literature, this study suggests that a brand can enhance customer equity, growth of the business customer and profits of the business customer by increasing in its efforts to influence the adoption of reverse-channels. Furthermore, the study proposes that an increase in the intention of a manufacturer to take on innovation in sustainability initiatives in its reverse logistics-based business process can increase the probability of the adoption of an approach towards reverse logistics. Research implications: This research extends the arguments made in innovation in sustainability initiatives theory by linking its three dimensions, i.e. economic, social and environmental, to reverse logistics and channel activities, as a function of a closed-loop supply chain. Practical implications: Synthesis of various theories discussed in this paper provides a theoretical toolbox that can guide manufacturers of brands to create value by generating profits and enhancing the growth of industrial firms. Originality/value/contribution: Using a systematic review of the literature, this study contributes to the area of research by developing a novel theoretical understanding of the role of a brand in creating value for business customers through the adoption of reverse channels. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor \& Francis Group, {LLC}.},

Practitioners and academics alike have started to emphasize social selling as a novel way to tackle these emerging opportunities and challenges at the sales force level. Since research in this area remains embryonic and fragmented, we adopt a discovery-oriented research approach and conceptualize social selling and its key facets based on a systematic literature review and a field study involving thought leading social selling professionals. The findings indicate a need to extend the research focus from social media usage into a concept which comprehends social selling as a broader application of digital marketing principles at the individual salesperson level. Social selling leverages social and digital channels for understanding, connecting with, and engaging influencers, prospects and existing customers at relevant customer purchasing journey touchpoints for building valuable business relationships. We relate the construct to other close selling approaches and explicate its organizational strategy components as well as performance outcomes. The findings advance current understanding of the role of sales in contemporary business markets and have implications for sales and marketing theory and practice. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The internet of things ({IoT}) is gaining attention from both scholars and practitioners regarding its potential as a key enabler of servitized business models; academic research on this emerging concept is increasing but overall underexplored, however. This paper comprehensively analyses and consolidates the relevant literature on the emerging concept of {IoT} and servitized business models through conducting a systematic literature review. Based on an analysis of 74 articles, four archetypes of business models are identified that are enabled by the {IoT}: add-on, sharing, usage-based and solution-oriented and supplemented with information on what role {IoT} adoption takes, benefits from the provider perspective, and the inhibiting factors per archetype. A framework draws the findings together and forms five propositions about these elements and their corresponding business models that may guide future empirical research and serve as a common typology. Therefore, this study contributes to the body of knowledge on innovative servitized business models by classifying emergent business models utilising {IoT} and what is currently known about them. For practice, this paper provides an overview for initial consideration by practitioners before adopting {IoT} in enabling servitized business models and the range of applications {IoT} may have in enabling servitized business models with examples. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Virtual reality ({VR}) is of increasing interest to marketers because it can be used to explore and proactively shape long-term futures, co-create value with consumers, and foster consumer-brand engagement. Yet, to date, the field lacks a cohesive framework for approaching {VR} research; thus, the objective of this systematic literature review is to provide such a framework and highlight research opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: First, after conducting a systematic literature review, we highlight {VR} themes instrumental to flow and propose a typology for {VR} research using realism-fantasy and immersion as dimensions. Next, we review the current state of empirical research for each quadrant. Finally, we synthesize research within each quadrant, specifying criteria and considerations for conducting research. In doing so, we propose an agenda for marketing research, centered on methodological, future studies, and consumer-related contributions. Findings: {VR} themes instrumental to flow include the avatar, application quality, and interactivity. We find, contrary to some conceptualizations of {VR}, that all applications are capable of producing flow. Conflicting research and gaps are highlighted in the findings section and summarized in Table {III}. Additionally, while prior research seems to draw from findings of other {VR} applications in advancing knowledge in general, the results of the literature review suggest that {VR} applications should be treated uniquely. Finally, we propose highly immersive {VR} applications as more conducive to future studies research. Research limitations/implications: Scholars can utilize the findings to prioritize future research studies in marketing. By following the typology and research opportunities, scholars can advance marketing theory and enhance the external validity of research studies through {VR} applications. Practical implications: Managers can utilize the findings to ascertain consumers and societies‘ responses to various marketing stimuli, with implications for product development, branding, retail/service experiences, adoption of new technologies, tourism, and many other domains. {VR} applications offer managers more ways of testing concepts and processes in realistic fashion without the costs and risks associated with more traditional methods. Originality/value: The objective of this paper is to examine varying opportunities for {VR} research given flow and fantasy potential and to prioritize {VR} research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In the current information age, when the attention spans of most people have become very short, marketers are facings serious challenges to grab the attention of their target audience effectively and fruitfully. From street corner to bedroom, virtually every perceivable location of human traces are littered with activity of marketers, whether they are small or large in scale or the recipients of their information understand the message properly. Studying consumers’ acceptance of the main ethical issues in communication, mainly in advertising, has recently been receiving much attention from scholars. Therefore, to grab the attention of people in the increasing competitive environment, advertisers have resorted to using what they feel can quickly attract the audience. For example, the attachment of attractive women with their physical natural endowments presented in explicit sexually appealing postures to products/services that have no linkage with women. These practices have raised some moral and ethical questions within the society. Therefore, this study aims to focus on discussing marketing communication through presenting women as a sexual object from the morality, ethics and religious perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: This is a descriptive study based on the systematic literature review. Initially, this paper discusses the ethical issues of using women and sexual appeals in the process of marketing communication, as well as the current level of practices in the industry. Then, it discusses the consequences and dimensions of the issues from different types of ethical grounds. Finally, it provides recommendations with the objective of finding a common ground from business and social perspectives. It also mentions the scopes of further research, which could lead the secular world to modify their moral values and come closer to the norms of other civilized societies. Findings: The position of the paper takes is that considering the negative effects of the prevalent advertising in society, the practice falls short of human moral values; as a result, it is considered unethical. Originality/value: This review paper examines the ethical implication of using women as marketing tools from the perspectives of morality, business and Islamic principles that will help business groups, as well as the whole religious community, especially Muslims. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Method: The research was conducted in the Capes (Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education Personnel), in the last 10 years, through blind review system. The scientific methods used were {SLR} (Systematic Literature Review), meta-analysis (Cooper, 2016) and content analysis (Bardin, 2011). Originality / Relevance: Despite recent surveys on higher education, the originality of the study can be justified by the lack of studies addressing the expectation on higher education using meta-analysis.

	abstract = {The internationalization process has been constantly moving with an exceptional transformation led by the digital era. In order to face the challenges of the internationalization, enterprises need to understand thoroughly the new business environment, including foreign markets and customer insights to offer innovative products and services. Indeed, big data as the new source of knowledge helps enterprises convert business information into competitive advantages in the global market. Although the topic of big data receives much attention from researchers, the adoption of big data in internationalization is still an emerging research interest, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises ({SMEs}). The purpose of this paper is to provide a concept-centric literature review that synthesizes and evaluates recent studies to examine the current state and future research directions of big data adoption in the internationalization process. The result of this paper indicates the status and future research directions of big data adoption in internationalization with the focus on international marketing.

	abstract = {Purpose: Recognising the potential of social media as an integral driver of communication that can create engaged communities through dialogic or two-way conversations, this study aims to identify and describe the use of social media in creating participants’ engagement in various social marketing programmes conducted worldwide between 2005 and 2017. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 29 social marketing programmes were identified using systematic literature review procedures. Findings: The majority of the identified programmes used Facebook, and social media were mostly used to share content-based information in an attempt to connect with target audiences, raise awareness and reach less accessible populations with programme messages. Social media served as an extended channel to traditional media efforts, and very few programmes used social media to create mechanisms for supporting their target audiences’ ability to revisit their social media communications and encourage them to act as advocates for the programmes’ activities. Research limitations/implications: The analysis presented in this paper is limited by the information provided in the identified studies. Originality/value: Despite the growing popularity and significance of social media as a channel for consumer engagement, little has been done to synthesise how social marketers are incorporating the use of social media in their social marketing programmes. This research fills this gap by providing systematic understanding of the use of social media in social marketing programmes to date. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The focal research topics in industrial marketing management have evolved significantly since {IMM} was first published in 1971. Part of this evolution has been the inclusion of research in supply chain management, which is the focus of this paper. The purpose of this paper is to assess themes across the classic articles in supply chain management ({SCM}) published in {IMM}, and explore how the field of {SCM} has evolved since their publication. A systematic literature review was used to assess {SCM} research in {IMM}, identify themes and publication patterns, and use these themes to assess gaps in extant research and opportunities for future research. Results of the literature review show that over 58\% of the {SCM} research published in {IMM} has focused on buyer-supplier relationships and other purchasing and supply management topics. These will continue to be key topics in {IMM}. In addition, our literature review suggests opportunities for more {SCM} research in {IMM} around sustainability, logistics, and manufacturing innovation. These areas within the {SCM} umbrella are under-researched, yet yield significant opportunities for future research in a time of constant change within companies' distribution models. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	doi = {10.1108/JBIM-07-2017-0162},
	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the topic of customer integration into supply chains. Particular attention is focused on literature concerning customer-driven and customer-centric supply chains. The aim is to provide a deeper understanding of these two approaches, clarify the differences, compare them and provide a conceptual model and research propositions, leading to theoretical and managerial implications. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a systematic literature review conducted using a consolidated methodology. The protocol used allows for the identification, analysis, synthesis, reporting and discussion of the results stemming from the literature on customer integration into the supply chain. This analysis enables us to summarize the results in a conceptual framework and introduce new research propositions. Findings: Using the results of the literature review, the authors first systematized the literature on customer-driven supply chain and on customer-centric supply chain in the conceptual framework. For each of the two sets of studies, the authors highlighted three main streams of research concerning customer integration into the supply chain. The authors analyzed three different topics: why customer integration is needed, how customer integration takes place and which intra-organizational issues are necessary to implement customer integration into the supply chain. Second, the authors developed a conceptual framework to confront customer-driven and customer-centric approaches to supply chain management in an evolutionary perspective. The authors thus formulated research propositions aimed at entering in greater depth the management of the shift from the customer-driven to customer-centric supply chain. Research limitations/implications: The systematic literature analysis developed in the paper contributed to more integrated and comprehensive knowledge of customer integration into the supply chain. The paper identifies and describes the characteristics of different supply chain approaches through the organization and interpretation of academics’ contributions. The paper suggests the need for further research in at least three areas: the study of variables supporting customer-driven or customer-centric approaches, the relevant intra-organizational issues underscoring the customer-centric supply chain and the impact of digitalization on supply chain processes. Practical implications: The paper outlines the main structural elements that compose the customer-driven and customer-centric supply chains. The results of the systematic analysis of the literature can be used to inform managers about the different levels and approaches for achieving customer integration. These diverse configurations of customer integration imply administrative and organizational considerations. Major issues to be considered when managers want to integrate the customer into the supply chain are identified. In addition, conditions underscoring different options – namely, customer-driven and customer-centric supply chains – are provided. Originality/value: The originality of this work lies in the systematic review of literature examining customer integration into supply chains, which highlights two main levels of customer integration: customer-driven and customer-centric. The main contribution is the formulation of a conceptual framework and new research propositions from the comparison and merger of these two configurations. The information presented in this paper enhances the literature on recent developments in customer integration, thereby enabling managers to select the most suitable configuration for the supply chain structure. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the status of the research on women’s financial planning for retirement. This paper provides a brief review of the work carried out so far along with a conceptual framework of factors influencing women’s retirement financial planning. In addition, it lists significant gaps and recommends avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The review is based on 151 articles appearing in various peer-reviewed journals published during 1980–2017. The study establishes its prominence by studying the publication activities based on the year of publication and region, citation analysis, research designs, data analysis techniques and findings from the selected articles. Findings: Most of the literature on women’s financial planning for retirement indicates a lack of financial management amongst women and their susceptibility to poverty in postretirement years. The majority of the research works in this field have taken place in developed economies. Empirical research with regression-based models for analysis is the most popular research design. This review also highlights the significant determinants of women’s retirement financial planning as identified through literature. These include socio-demographic factors, psychological constructs, financial literacy, economic and circumstantial forces. Originality/value: This paper covers the research works done in this area in the past 38 years. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to provide a systematic and comprehensive compilation of the knowledge in this subject. It further synthesizes the findings of various studies on factors influencing women’s retirement financial planning and gives recommendations for future studies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, service actors are increasingly behaving offensive, destructive, and hostile with intentions to harm each other, service provision processes, the well-being of the organization, and its brand (Fisk et al. 2010; Grandey et al. 2007; Kähr et al. 2016). The skyrocketing number of negative experiences with service providers within service environments leads to more destructive and offensive hostility as a new phenomenon (Kähr et al. 2016), previously observed in intraorganizational relations (Analoui 1995). We introduce the concept of “targeted dysfunctionality” as a bridging construct that indicates “intended to harm” oriented service actor behaviors. We employed a systematic literature review of the harm-motivated dysfunctional behavior studies in both organizational behavior and marketing literatures. As a further stage of the systematic review, a meta-analytic review was conducted for testing the validity of the suggested typology in service contexts. In the systematic review, we concluded that 4 of 17 constructs (aggression, sabotage, incivility, and production deviance) can clearly explain “targeted dysfunctionality” with two dimensions (ambiguity of harm intention and humanization in service contexts). Based on these two dimensions, we defined targeted dysfunctionality as “(Un)ambiguous dysfunctional actions of service actors that are dominantly motivated by causing harm to other actors and processes in service ecosystems.” One of the main dimensions that delineate a meaningful distinction between sub-constructs is “ambiguity of harm.” Aggression and sabotage constructs have clear relations with “intent to harm” motivation, but it is hard to determine the harm motivation behind incivility and product deviance. The other dimension, which is critical to dissociate the sub-constructs, is the person-targeted/process-targeted dichotomy. Aggressive and uncivil behaviors are clearly directed at a person or a group of people (i.e., teams). On the other hand, the main goal of sabotage and production deviance behaviors is harming organizational processes (i.e., service-providing processes), rather than harming people or organizational members. In the meta-analytic review, we found significant relationships between employee-targeted dysfunctional customer behaviors (customer mistreatment) and dysfunctional employee behaviors (aggression, incivility, service sabotage, and production deviance). Supporting our typology, we found significant differences between the effect sizes of employee aggression, employee incivility, service sabotage, and production deviance. The relationship between aggression and customer mistreatment was trivial (ρ = 0.058). On the other hand, we found strong positive effects of customer mistreatment on incivility, sabotage, and production deviance in different levels (ρ = 0.403; ρ = 0.359; ρ = 0.275, respectively).

	abstract = {Employer brand love originates from two different constructs—employer brand and brand love. When performing a quick search in several databases from mainstream to scientific literature, some attempts to present these two constructs mixed together can be seen but mainly from a relationship standpoint and not as a new concept altogether. The authors’ research purpose is to develop a conceptual model build upon an extensive and systematic literature review. In 2006, Sartain and Schumann defined employer brand as: “how a business builds and packages its identity, from its origins and values, what it promises to deliver to emotionally connect employees so that they in turn deliver what a business promises to customers.” Literature review on brand love has mainly concentrated on its conceptualization. Factors that drive brand love and its outcomes have yet not received the necessary attention (Albert and Merunka 2013; Batra et al. 2012). Nevertheless, literature has shown factors that drive brand love such as hedonic brand, brand image, brand quality, interpersonal antecedents, brand trust, and brand identification (Albert and Merunka 2013; Batra et al. 2012; Carroll and Ahuvia 2006; Ismail and Spinelli 2012; Tolbert and Gammoh 2012). For this study, we apply the systematic literature review protocol, considering the experience of previous studies (Hjalager 2010; Kofinas and Saur-Amaral 2008; Kusluvan et al. 2010; Law et al. 2010; Irina Saur-Amaral 2011, 2012). Firstly, we build the review protocol, based on keywords previously used by other authors. Descriptive statistics is used to identify main authors, dates, and journals’ names and scopes. A more qualitative analysis is performed for content analysis using {RefViz} and {NVivo} using as orientation framework the keywords and the previous knowledge on the concept (Charmaz 2006). The literature map is built upon the data obtained from content analysis, and the explanatory descriptions of key themes and topics are supported by citations and references obtained from {NVivo} and {RefViz} analysis. Further work to be undertaken includes interviews and focus groups with key players on the field (marketing professors and {HR} professionals) to explore the conceptual model.

The results reveal that the association between place branding and agro-food products can generate synergistic effects for the parties involved. This relationship is found to be dominant in previous studies analysed, identifying 19 different agro-food products which correspond to a universe of 108 brands and/or names.

Design/methodology/approach: To systematically review the empirical literature that simultaneously tests the core tenets of {EO} and {MO}, this study followed a multi-step approach, which has served as a replicable literature review method in previous studies. A final sample of 121 papers published between 1987 and 2016 was developed. Findings: The results show that {EO}–{MO} relationship research has made considerable strides in recent years and is accelerating and broadening. This interest is manifested in the 83 journals and 266 authors that were identified. Additionally, the results confirm that the Anglo region contributed the majority of {EO}–{MO} relationships in the study sample. Finally, the 121 papers in the sample were organized into six different approaches, which in turn represent 53 research models where the unidimensional conceptualizations of {EO} and {MO} were predominant. Originality/value: This study has shown that the {EO}–{MO} relationship has been studied from different approaches, which revealed several research models that advance the knowledge on relationships between {EO} and {MO}. {EO} and {MO} are, in turn, also positively associated with firm performance.

It is not clear, however, how effectively the concept of co-creation has been incorporated within place marketing. This research takes a step forward toward covering this gap by: (1) drawing on service-dominant logic and related perspectives to propose a co-creation-led, baseline framework; (2) conducting a systematic review of quantitative place-marketing research that has attempted to incorporate the value co-creation perspective; (3) critically reviewing these research efforts; and (4) providing future research avenues. Overall, this research shows that quantitative place-marketing literature is advancing towards incorporating the co-creation proposal, although that is primarily so in destination and hospitality contexts.

Thereupon, we address the research question with an empirical study. Our sample includes 139 industrial enterprises from Poland and Germany, which purchase sensor technology from a common German supplier. We test the impact of the buying frequency, the function of the person buying, the industry sector and the country of origin on the perception of the five developments identified in our literature review related to {DSMM}. Based on these findings, we derive strategies for customer segmentation associated to {DSMM} in industrial buying. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

Design/methodology/approach: The paper builds upon a systematic literature review of {IoT} ecosystems and business models to construct a conceptual framework on {IoT} business models, and uses qualitative research methods to analyze seven industry cases. Findings: The study identifies four types of {IoT} business models: value chain efficiency, industry collaboration, horizontal market and platform. Moreover, it discusses three evolutionary paths of new business model emergence: opening up the ecosystem for industry collaboration, replicating the solution in multiple services and return to closed ecosystem as technology matures. Research limitations/implications: Identifying business models in rapidly evolving fields such as the {IoT} based on a small number of case studies may result in biased findings compared to large-scale surveys and globally distributed samples. However, it provides more thorough interpretations. Practical implications: The study provides a framework for analyzing the types and emergence of {IoT} business models, and forwards the concept of “value design” as an ecosystem business model. Originality/value: This paper identifies four archetypical {IoT} business models based on a novel framework that is independent of any specific industry, and argues that {IoT} business models follow an evolutionary path from closed to open, and reversely to closed ecosystems, and the value created in the networks of organizations and things will be shareable value rather than exchange value. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This systematic literature review identified 16 studies that have assessed anti-human trafficking campaigns but found that none of these included outcome, process, or impact evaluations. As identified in our study, anti-human trafficking campaigns tend to rely on advertising techniques to target vulnerable groups and the wider public, with the primary aim of informing and educating. Further, a thematic analysis of the studies identified problems in eight areas that require attention in the future development of anti-human trafficking campaigns: stereotyping, compounding human trafficking with migration, conflating prostitution with human trafficking, sexualization/erotization of women, victimization, role of anti-human trafficking organizations, data shortcomings, and oversimplification of human trafficking. Studies presenting the results of evaluations of social marketing anti-human trafficking campaigns are urgently needed to show which social marketing tools work and to provide an evidence base for future campaigns. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.},

Drivers, barriers and future pathways of {CFC} – from the business and consumer’s perspective – are extracted, summarized and discussed. By using a holistic approach, this study aims to demonstrate the linkages and interplays among the actors. Helpful implications for the industry and policy makers are derived. Design/methodology/approach: A holistic systematic literature review was conducted. More than 2,800 journal articles were reviewed for this conceptual paper, and the ones meeting the search criteria were subjected to a qualitative content analysis. Findings: The findings facilitate a better understanding of what enables or prevents {CFC} from becoming a mainstream consumption approach. The study also examines the sustainability aspects of {CFC}, discussing both the positive environmental benefits and its negative impacts. Practical implications: The results of this study can help businesses, governments and institutions develop more efficient strategies toward promoting sustainability in the fashion industry. Understanding the drivers and barriers of {CFC}, in addition to the possible sustainability benefits of {CFC}, can facilitate and accelerate adoption of future business models of {CFC}. Originality/value: {CFC} is a relatively new concept in the field of academic research. In fact, this study is among the first to explore the interplay of drivers and barriers from both the consumer and industry perspectives.

Sports sponsorship is a key health promotion strategy, yet academic literature on the use of sponsorship in social marketing and public health is surprisingly limited. Design/methodology/approach: Seventeen studies were identified following systematic literature review procedures. Findings: Coupling of social marketing and public health sponsorship with changes in policies in sporting clubs and associations offers an effective means to achieve desired outcomes, e.g. behaviour change. Research limitations/implications: The analysis presented in this review included information that was reported in the identified studies, which might be an incomplete representation of work undertaken but not reported. All of the studies identified in this review were conducted in English-speaking countries. Considerable opportunity for future research is apparent, and areas for future research are outlined. Practical implications: Limited evidence was available, and additional research examining the effectiveness of sponsorship in attaining behavioural change is urgently needed. Future studies should assess the role, scope of involvement in, aims and benefits of non-government sponsors of public health and social marketing campaigns; use methods that do not rely on self-reporting, such as observations; and explore the influence of health sponsorship on attitudes, social norms and behaviours.

	abstract = {Experience has become a key element in understanding consumer behaviour (Addis \& Holbrook, 2001). Brand experience can create added value (Whelan \& Wohlfeil, 2006) and is an important concept for academics as it has been tied to several key branding constructs including brand personality (Brakus, Schmitt, \& Zarantello, 2009; Helm \& Jones, 2010; Ramaseshan \& Stein, 2014), brand loyalty (Biedenbach \& Marell, 2010), and brand relationships (Tully, Hershfield, \& Meyvia, 2015). The currently accepted conceptualization of brand experience has several shortcomings in its richness. Firstly, brand experience is considered to occur immediately (Brakus et al., 2009; Nowak, 2006), and not over a period of time. Secondly, brand experience has only been measured in the post-consumption stage (Brocato, Voorhees, \& Baker; 2012; Gilboa et al., 2016), implying that it doesn’t exist in the pre- and during consumption stages. Thirdly, the role of sensations and feelings is muted as their affect is only measured in its existence (Brakus et al., 2009). Therefore, many consider the accepted conceptualization of brand experience to be limited and call for a greater interdisciplinary approach to be adopted when grappling with the complexity of brand experience (Morgan-Thomas \& Veloutsou, 2013; Rose, Hair, \& Clark, 2011; Taylor \& Strutton, 2010), with some arguing that the process of how experiences are formed should be prioritized (Edvardsson, Enquist, \& Johnston, 2005; Schmitt et al., 2015), but this call has been largely ignored (Schmitt et al., 2015). Using appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria, a systematic literature review in marketing, philosophy and phycology was contacted and identified 132, 75 and 22 articles for analysis, respectively. The overall objective was to see how brand experience can be approached as a process. Contradicting the current conceptualisation of brand experience as a dyadic construct (Brakus et al., 2009; Gilboa et al., 2016; Pine \& Gilmore, 1999), insights from philosophy and psychology view experience as a dynamic process which is conceptualized into levels (Bartsch \& Oliver, 2014; Dewey, 1929; Erlich, 2003; James 1976 [1912]); Locke, 1979). The number of levels varies between two and three; however, there is a consistent description of these levels, namely, Level 1, subconscious experience; Level 2, immediate experience; and Level 3, consummatory experience. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.},

	abstract = {A growing body of research has emerged on digital retailing due to the introduction and rapid spread of technologies that changed the retail settings. Retailers are constantly making decisions about the implementation of digital technologies, evaluating every negative and positive effect from the costs saving to the customers’ satisfaction (Verhoef et al., 2009). These developments are modifying the way to do shopping, making it more exciting and involving, thanks to a large range of services offered (Liao \& Shi, 2009). This systematic review of the literature (Tranfield et al., 2003) aims to identify, classify, and analyze the main current research fields on digital retailing developing an overall interpretation of the topic investigated. The process of analysis has been divided into three stages. In the first one, authors planned the review by delimiting the subject area, identifying the main purposes of the analysis, and consequently developing the review protocol including details of the information source (authors, title, year of publication, journal, keywords). During the second stage, authors collected the papers published from 2013 to 2016 in the databases {EBSCO}, Scopus, {ScienceDirect}, and Web of Science. In order to retrieve relevant publications in the field of digital retailing, authors selected the search query keywords “digital” and “online” linked via Boolean and with the keyword “retailing.” The search resulted in overall 693 articles. After a screening process, authors select 290 papers belonging to the field of B2C level and tangible goods digital retailing. In the third stage, authors codified the results by running a content analysis through the software {NVivo} (Bazeley \& Jackson, 2013) aiming at codifying a set of main themes, according to the thematic analysis approach (Braun \& Clarke, 2006). The themes were identified launching the auto-coding wizard query of the software on titles, abstracts, and keywords allowing researchers in the identification of the main topics. This process resulted in both father nodes and son nodes, summarized by authors into six father nodes with relative son nodes. Finally, the interactions among the nodes were measured to understand the eventual conceptual links and bonds between them, running the word similarity cluster analysis, through the using of the Pearson correlation, a tool for estimating the linear relationship between two quantitative random variables (De Oña et al., 2014). To conclude, authors assigned each paper to the six clusters identified, namely, consumer behavior, customer-firm relationships, multichannel distribution, touchpoints management, branding and communication, and product and service management. Starting from these preliminary results, authors aim to shed light on the evolution of digital retailing research streams for supporting scholars to conceptualize the future development of this emerging phenomenon and practitioners to assume their managerial decisions on a consistent framework. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.},

	abstract = {Consumers currently place increasing importance on the values that companies represent. Modern values such as transparency, benevolence to society, sustainability and fairness are becoming more relevant, as noted by many major consulting firms among which are Nielsen (2013), the World Federation of Advertisers (2013) and the Boston Consultancy Group (2013). Modern values are grounded in social, political and economic developments and represent the new values of this era. As a consequence, a company’s value to consumers no longer has to lie solely in its products and services. This new, broader scope of value may include the entire business process and organizational culture, ranging from the management’s integrity to values being found in the company’s contributions to society. Although the role of values in human behaviour has been extensively discussed in the psychology literature since the beginning of the 1900s (e.g. Feather 1995; Hofstede 1980; Olson and Maio 2003; Rokeach 1973; Schwartz 2012), limited attention has been dedicated to values in marketing literature. This was the conclusion of a systematic literature review that we conducted on this subject (Voorn et al. 2016). As a follow-up, we organized an online survey (n = 1109) to empirically investigate the role of values in the brand selection process. In this paper, we report on the relationship between values and brand purchase intentions through the concept of value congruence and in relation to several product categories representing services, durables and consumables. Overall, the results confirm the relevance of value congruence as a predictor of brand purchase, in particular in services and durables. Our study shows that companies can benefit from incorporating values into their marketing strategies, especially those values that are congruent with (higher-order) personal goals, rather than more (instrumental) category-specific values. This offers new marketing perspectives, especially for brands. Brands are – by definition – more than just one product or service, which means they can serve as an umbrella for the incorporation and propagation of new values. However, an important question remains for the brand manager: the extent to which values have an advantage over brand personality traits and functional attributes, since investing in values is not only about communication – it means that an organization needs to embody them in the very fibre of its being; otherwise it may be perceived as ‘green washing’, which can undermine brand trust. © 2018, Springer International Publishing {AG}.},

Content analysis, of various definitions, implies that it should be a multidimensional construct which is guided by several parameters, namely, corporate vision, organizational culture, market dynamics, and stakeholder objectives. Thus, a systematic literature review integrates structure-conduct-performance theory, resource-based theory, and market orientation concepts to redefine brand orientation as a three-dimensional construct with the following interdependent components: cognition, creation, and calibration. Secondly, it suggests that organizational factors (culture and philosophy, interdepartmental coordination, and growth intention) and market factors (competitor intensity, brand sensitivity of stakeholders, and market life cycle) affect the degree of brand orientation. Thirdly, it extends that brand orientation leads to the brand value which comprises of three elements, existential value, experiential value, and economic value, drawn on the theory of existentialism and the meanings associated with consumption. Thus, firms cannot transform themselves into brand-oriented companies until systemic arrangements are made to consider organizational and market factors. A firm should formulate a “brand development plan” by “knowing thyself and environment,” “investing into brand identity and image-building programs,” and “brand review.” © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.},

This study revealed that the behavioual intentions primarily depend upon the attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control. Loss of income, fear of losing a job, and lucrative incentives offered by insurance companies motivate agents to push the products by engaging in unscrupulous practices that violate the ethical norms.

Five challenges are identified: organisational structure, business model, development process, customer management, and risk management.

	abstract = {The term alumni loyalty ({AL}) is widely used by scientists in various disciplines and particularly often in discussions of the key factors influencing alumni contributions. However, research in this field varies considerably in its assumptions and methods and contains contradictory findings. Additionally, there is no consistent definition of {AL}. This situation makes it difficult for the university administration to see the overall picture or to evaluate which results are most reliable and should be used as the basis for practice and policy decisions. A systematic literature review ({SLR}) would address these problems by identifying, meticulously evaluating, and integrating findings of the relevant studies. To date, no {SLR} has been undertaken in the field of alumni loyalty. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, the paper conducts an {SLR} in this research area. Second, the study provides a more comprehensive definition of alumni loyalty. The research identified 102 relevant articles and classified them according to seven theoretical approaches: microeconomics, charitable giving, management, relationship marketing, educational science, services marketing, and the integrative approach, which combines the above disciplines. Having determined four primary aspects of {AL} (behavioral, attitudinal, material and nonmaterial), the paper derives four quadrants of {AL} definitions and assigns each publication to one or two of them. Following this step, the overall picture and definition of {AL} were derived. The findings can be used by academics as a framework to position new research activities appropriately and by practitioners as a roadmap to enhance {AL} rate. © 2017 Taylor \& Francis.},

This exploratory study suggests an ongoing need for examining the effectiveness of types of brand value propositions in terms of both the managerial process in which they are constructed as well as the precision of such brand promises on customer understanding. The paper concludes with a suggestion for more robust empirical research on the construction and deconstruction of brand value propositions, a need for more managerially focused research, and a future research that examines the under-researched area of how value propositions are effectively communicated on branded websites. © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 2017.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, rapid industrial modernization and economic growth have brought substantial environmental problems such as air pollution, hazardous waste, and water pollution for the Asian emerging economies ({AEE}), in particular China, Taiwan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and South Korea. These countries have started to adopt green supply chain management ({GSCM}) as a strategy to reduce the environmental impact. There are anecdotal evidences that the adoption of {GSCM} in this region is partly influenced by Guanxi – a cultural norm, which plays a significant role in relationship governance within supply chain activities among the {AEE}. Based on a systematic literature review, we develop a conceptual framework that characterizes the drivers and barriers for the adoption of {GSCM} practices, incorporating Guanxi as a moderator in the manufacturing sector of the {AEE}. The conceptual framework addresses the roles of two types of Guanxi in the adoption of {GSCM}: the relational Guanxi at individual level based on social exchange theory and the aggregated Guanxi at firm level derived from social capital theory. This recognition of Guanxi at two separate decision levels help companies better manage their relationships while they green their supply chains. Directions for future research and managerial implications are discussed accordingly. © 2017 The Authors},

However, this body of research has not been subject to a systematic literature review. Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to provide a systematic review of the trade show marketing literature with the aim of delineating its current state, trends, gaps and inconsistencies. To this end, multiple electronic databases were searched and 91 trade show articles published in 24 marketing journals were extracted. The extracted articles were carefully analyzed with the help of a comprehensive classification framework focusing on broad thematic, theoretical and methodological dimensions. The findings revealed that: (a) trade show research is marked by inconsistencies that concern core thematic issues, such as trade show participation modes, trade show activity stages and trade show performance; (b) trade show research is atheoretical for the most part, but has become increasingly theory oriented in recent years; and (c) trade show research is heavily dependent on a combination of cross-sectional designs and surveys, with limited application of other designs and data collection approaches. Building on these findings, the review proposes an extensive research agenda to help move the trade show marketing literature forward. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

In particular, our interest is on evaluating the extent to which the {IMP} Interaction Approach is used to underpin or influence the focus of existing research and exploring the opportunities for further research into sustainable purchasing and supply guided by an {IMP} perspective. The methodology employed is a systematic literature review (Tranfield et al., 2003). A systematic search process is used to identify 1899 papers that are gradually reduced through a filtering process to 276 papers. The theoretical perspective of each paper is identified and recorded in a database along with methodology, unit of analysis and reported findings. We find that a significant proportion of sustainable purchasing and supply management papers adopt stakeholder theory, institutional theory and resource-based perspectives, however, relatively few papers rely on an {IMP} Interaction Approach. We evaluate the rationale for the typical theoretical perspectives adopted and discuss the potential for the {IMP} Interaction Approach to underpin studies of sustainable purchasing and supply management. The paper concludes by outlining future avenues of research that specify how the {IMP} Interaction Approach can underpin and further advance sustainable purchasing and supply research. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of ambivalence in consumer behavior, its varying and fragmented definitions have made it challenging to understand what ambivalence really means to consumer researchers. This is problematic because the lack of precise conceptualization hinders scientific progress (Teas and Palan 1997) and leads to validity and measurement issues, ill-advised understanding of relationships between concepts, and reduced credibility of research findings ({MacKenzie} 2003). Thus, in search for greater clarity of the consumer ambivalence concept, this paper first analyzes how ambivalence has been defined in consumer research and subsequently divides the definitions into categories and subcategories of consumer ambivalence. Systematic literature review is used to meet this goal, following a standard procedure of (1) database search with the keyword combinations “consumer” and “ambivalence” and “consumer” and “mixed emotions,” (2) exclusion of papers not in scope of the review based on predefined exclusion criteria, and (3) analysis of the conceptualizations used in the papers. Based on this process, a categorization of different types of ambivalences is developed, including the categories of attitudinal ambivalence, mixed emotions, and consumer culture theory-based ambivalence and their subcategories. Finally, a synthesizing view of consumer ambivalence is suggested based on the review and categorization of the definitions, which takes into account the wide spectrum of consumer research. This paper thus advances theoretical discussion of ambivalence in consumer research by providing a clear structure for what is meant by ambivalence in different streams of consumer research, and how these conceptualizations can be synthesized under the umbrella of consumer ambivalence. Finally, a research agenda for consumer ambivalence is developed, including suggestions for more thorough research on the temporal aspects of consumer ambivalence as they relate to consumer decision-making processes, the measurement of ambivalence, and the relationships between consumer ambivalence and other types of consumption-related conflicts.

Walt Disney is said to be one of the pioneers of brandscaping, the act of transforming a brand itself into a physical location (Riewoldt, Brandscaping: Worlds of Experience in Retail Design. Erlebnisdesign für Einkaufswelten. Basel, Boston, {MA}: Birkhauser-Publishers for Architecture, 2002). These brand worlds, like flagship stores or brand museums, are evident in B2C on many occasions nowadays and provide visitors with a unique brand experience. Academic research has been carried out, even if on a small level. In industrial marketing in contrast, these brand worlds have not been subject to academic research so far. This paper lays the foundation for future research on the topic of brand worlds in industrial marketing. It is based on a systematic literature review and qualitative content analysis of the B2C literature, as well as practical examples. The authors suggest a set of variables and categories to give a first overview on which forms of brand worlds already exist in industrial marketing and how they could be distinguished. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science.},

	abstract = {Practitioner adoption of consumer engagement as a metric remains problematic. Just as the scholastic world has begun to regard engagement as a critical construct that can lead to consumption, brand-supporting behaviours and ultimately purchases, practitioner discourse has grown pessimistic if not disdainful towards it—a view encapsulated in Martin Weigel’s influential description of engagement as a verb, not a metric and ‘fashionable but bankrupt’ (Weigel 2010). To marketers, engagement remains a handy ‘mantra’ to legitimise a marketing strategy or embellish the provenance of a digital technology. The behavioural algorithms of programmatic buying are the preferred practitioner indicators of performance or {ROI}. There are, however, excellent conceptual reasons for believing engagement to be an important construct in shaping consumer behaviour (Mollen and Wilson 2010; Hollebeek et al. 2016). The motivation for this study is, therefore, to establish consumer engagement as a sustainable metric, demonstrably capable of widespread adoption. We selected Website Publisher engagement as a context. A systematic literature review generated a preliminary scale of 150 items representing five core dimensions. This was reduced to 60 items using an academic and practitioner expert panel. A survey of 12,000 consumers across 14 websites under the {BSkyB} umbrella was used to refine the scale into a parsimonious 12 items, grouped into four dimensions: cognitive processing, temporal needs, self-congruence and social identity. In two smaller studies, the scale was tested against advertising performance metrics, namely, ad and brand awareness, message recall and brand attitudes. Finally, the scale was applied, through a survey of 3000 consumers, across a broad range of websites representing a spread of content genres, to establish nomological validity and investigate further consequences of consumer engagement. Results suggest that (1) outcomes of engagement include website trust, satisfaction, loyalty and {WOM} and (2) a relationship between the cognitive–affective engagement construct and engagement behaviour exist, but customer heterogeneity is present in this relationship. The study supports the scholastic view that consumer engagement is a critical measure, central in its relationship to key predictors of marketing return (Calder et al. 2015). However, the implication for practitioners, as a result of the investigation into the experiential–behavioural axis, is that the current practice of reliance on behavioural and temporal proxies for {CE} is not robust. An engagement score is proposed that practitioners can use supplement existing measures and substantively improve their brand and media auditing—an exercise that may ameliorate practitioner antipathy to experiential metrics and effect a productive reconciliation with academic opinion. Further research is called for to explore whether such a standardised score can indeed be used as a universal measure, or whether context-specific measures are required.

	abstract = {Purpose: The activewear industry would benefit from an evidence-based understanding of how activewear is incorporated into women’s lives and their changing participation in physical activity. Activewear brands may be missing the trend of women moving from organised sport to non-organised and individualised sport and recreation. The purpose of this paper is to explore the degree to which academic and industry research understood patterns and influences on female’s activewear consumption and identified what significant gaps are evident in understanding the drivers and industry trends that pertain to female consumers of activewear. Design/methodology/approach: The systematic literature review sought academic and industry research papers. Articles were selected if they included female participants; and/or addressed consumer related information; and focussed on active wear. Article findings were thematically analysed. Findings: Most literature exploring activewear consumption fails to take gender into consideration or explore unique female consumer profiles. Females are bringing activewear into other parts of their wardrobe and place more value on fashion, even for sports attire. Research identified the need for activewear brands to consider lifestyle, emotional and personality elements of consumer behaviour. However a specific focus on women’s branding was absent. Women’s age and generation influenced their activewear consumption. Although some industry reports discussed the shift in use of activewear, no studies explored the impact of the critical shift in women’s physical activity patterns on the activewear industry. Originality/value: This review identifies the gap in knowledge regarding women’s activewear consumption patterns and needs, and the importance of reflecting the changes in female physical activity participation. It also links marketing and design of women’s activewear to the needs of female consumers based on their actual patterns and trends in physical activity. The findings are relevant to activewear researchers, brands, marketers and producers. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to generate novel insights in supply chain management by reviewing studies related to counterfeiting and piracy issues with a particular emphasis on theoretical works. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of more than 100 peer-reviewed academic papers is conducted. The authors first introduce the social acceptance of counterfeiting and piracy to explain the existence of these illegal products. After that, they focus on the negative effect of counterfeiting and piracy on supply chain management and society while mentioning their positive and normative effects carefully under certain circumstances. Findings: People have been attempting to reveal the impacts of counterfeiting and piracy on customers, licit firms, industry sectors, governments and the society as a whole. The negative impacts of counterfeiting and piracy on legal firms and licit supply chains is examined thoroughly in the literature; however, benefits from counterfeiting and piracy are also pointed out. Additionally, researchers are interested in firms’ reactions toward this phenomenon. Based on heuristics from the above analysis, it is fruitful to conduct this research in a theme of supply chain management. Originality/value: Most studies on counterfeiting and piracy are not from a supply chain management perspective and mainly focus on their effect on consumers or a single firm. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is one of few studies that incorporate the key aspects of counterfeiting and piracy into supply chain management and also highlight several important directions for future research in the sense of supply chain. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The framework proposed in this paper can be utilized to develop marketing strategies to target young consumers. In the Indian context, this is a good study done for targeting Indian youth by Indian marketers in the retail sector. Findings: The youth quotient and digital media emerged as the most important factor, followed by consumerism. Interrelations otherwise not easily observable established their prominence. An important fact that evolved is that almost all the factors had interdependence and were in coherence. Limitations: The research limits itself to a conceptual understanding of buying behavior amongst youngsters for online shopping; however, it does not show the results at a microscopic level. It is inclusive of factors at the macro level. The outcome is based on intense literature review. Directions for Further Research: The present study needs to be further investigated under the light of market dimensions and issues. The model developed can be empirically validated by utilizing the conceptual framework.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the potential contribution that purchasing {KIBS} may have on innovation at the buying firm. It integrates the results of a systematic literature review on purchasing {KIBS} with literatures respectively on purchasing and {KIBS} contribution to innovation. Based on the outcomes of an extensive study of the literature, a theoretical framework is proposed in order to understand what could boost innovation outcomes of purchasing {KIBS}, especially for the buying firms. The framework suggests observing the {KIBS} triad configuration, i.e. the relationship between {KIBS} providers, the purchasing function and the user area within the buying firm, and its contingencies and characteristics. Overall, the paper suggests that the way {KIBS} are purchased can influence their effect on the innovation they generate, offers insights on aspects that need to be considered to increase potential innovation outcomes, and draws attention to the strategic role that purchasing can play in this context. In this way, it moves beyond the debate on purchasing involvement in {NPD} (new product development) and shows another domain ({KIBS} services) in which purchasing can contribute to the development of innovation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to clarify why, when and how e-mail marketing can be used to empower consumers and to give ideas for future scholarly research. Design/methodology/approach: Systematic literature review studies 41 e-mail marketing and 54 consumer empowerment articles published in variety of academic journals between 1998 and 2014. Findings: E-mail allows an active, interactive and personalized communication fulfilling the preferences of an empowered consumer. E-mail marketing can be used to empower consumers by sending e-mails based on permission, by making consumers active participants in the communication process and by making e-mails relevant for the recipients. However, current e-mail marketing strategies need to be updated to get the maximum benefit out of the channel. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of the study is the broad domain of research, which hampered the in-depth analysis. However, the study was able to synthesize the scattered literature and create an overall picture of the topic as planned. Practical implications: The paper encourages managers to use empowering e-mail marketing strategies and presents several suggestions for future e-mail marketing research. Originality/value: The paper uses a new perspective, consumer empowerment as a lens for understanding e-mail marketing. Because e-mail marketing is currently very popular among marketers but is threatened by its negative image among consumers, it is important to understand how e-mail marketing can be developed so that it can also survive in the future. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {While research on the phenomenon of coopetition has dramatically increased during the last years, this line of inquiry often embodies a loosely connected body of work with fragmented themes, underdeveloped concepts, and little work explaining coopetition at multiple levels. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review of the field, and based on a final set of 142 contributions, synthesize the disparate research into a coherent whole by developing an overarching and dynamic multilevel model. We first systematize diverse conceptualizations of coopetition with respect to different levels into The Actor and The Activity Schools of Thought. Then we integrate major critical themes into a Driver, Process, Outcomes ({DPO}) framework, and offer a Blended School of Thought to show how different levels are intertwined and affect each other. Next, we develop a multilevel conceptual model of coopetition by integrating the Blended School into the {DPO} framework. This model helps future research better understand how the phenomena of coopetition at one level of analysis are distinct, yet interlinked, from coopetition at other levels, and in so doing, provides a richer and more complete perspective of the phenomenon of coopetition. Finally, we identify promising research avenues and suggest how future research can strengthen this line of inquiry. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

Focus groups, interviews or surveys, all of which are self-report methods, are the most commonly reported methods employed in formative research.

A systematic literature review was conducted to identify social marketing interventions published in peer reviewed journals whose reported aim was to reduce harm caused by alcohol from 2000 to May 2015. This paper considers the extent of stakeholder involvement in key stages of social marketing interventions, namely the formative research, implementation, and evaluation stages. The number of stakeholders was greatest in more complex community settings when compared to more narrow settings such as universities and schools. A restricted stakeholder focus was observed for evaluation. Stakeholder theory, a widely used management theory, can guide downstream social marketing intervention planning and design, implementation, and evaluation to deliver sustainable programmes. Limited stakeholder involvement in social marketing interventions limits their potential. Given limited stakeholder involvement was identified in the current review, the use of a broader array of stakeholders in formative research and evaluation is recommended to optimise behavioural outcomes. © 2016 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.},

A systematic search strategy was conducted which identified 166 self-labelled social marketing health interventions reported in 242 refereed journal articles. Nutrition was the most popular topic, followed by alcohol prevention, {HIV}/{AIDS}, and physical activity. A majority of these interventions reported conducting some form of formative research activities to understand the target audience’s characteristics, attitudes, behaviours, and preferred communication channels. Theory and model use was not always reported. Qualitative methods were employed in nearly half of the identified interventions. Relatively limited stakeholder participation in formative research activities was found, particularly of policy makers.

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify current impediments to the competitiveness of the rail industry in the Australian non-bulk freight market. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic literature review was adapted to identify the impediments and challenge themes from 1,081 studies available on the Australian rail industry. To select the studies relevant to the research question, a tollgate criterion was then deployed. Impediments were identified by a structured data synthesis process and a heuristic algorithm was developed to explore the possible relationships between the impediments and challenges. Findings – Four major themes are apparent, each of which presents the rail industry with challenges in the non-bulk freight market. “Infrastructural inefficiencies and the need for further integration” was ranked as the main rail industry challenge, while “environmental concerns and the associated costs of externalities” was the least. In addition, across the four themes data synthesis identified 43 impediments from purely policy related to technical and operational aspects. Research limitations/implications – The major implication of this review is the identification of impediments that have no linkage to the four industry challenges as revealed by stakeholders in the literature. That means that the rail industry has been dealing with a number of issues that have not been explored and studied in depth either by practitioners or academics. The underlying elements of impediments in this group are perceived as managerial, organisational and leadership factors. The rail industry has failed to manage its organisational ties across the system, both horizontally and vertically. This issue has been intensified as the result of complex interactions between different transport modes and operators associated with the non-bulk freight sector. Originality/value – For the first time in the Australian context, this study provides an en masse and summarised picture of impediments to the competitiveness of the rail industry in the non-bulk freight market by systematically reviewing the reports generated by different stakeholders in the last ten years. The outcomes will assist the rail industry and government to understand impediments impacting on the quality of rail freight services that may lead to collaboration on decision-making and investment strategies. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach - Use of Jaworski’s framework on role-relevance to classify the type of relevance addressed in 29 journal articles. A systematic literature review on solution business preceded the selection of articles and a concern to include different journal categories. Findings - Managerial implications in the studied articles within solution business do not seem to emphasize role-relevance particularly; they rather address applicability of findings on a company level and for B2B marketing in a more general sense. The majority of implications for practice are framed to have an impact on “present actions”. Managerial knowledge needs are dominantly addressed by “empirical findings” or “frameworks”. The dominating managerial core tasks addressed are “transformer of marketing” and “marketing strategy”. Research limitations/implications - There do not seem to be studies with managerial implications addressing future actions and thinking; providing instruments, methods or models that are role- relevant; focusing on the challenges of a “coordinator”, “strategist” or “performance controller”. The focus on solution business limits the generalizability of findings. Practical implications - Results suggest that implications for practice potentially would benefit from being written in the form of explicit recommendations; targeted to a particular managerial role; and increasingly developed when it comes to proposed frameworks for them to be useful for managers in industrial marketing. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies to systematically examine the character of managerial implications by categorizing results in accordance with a framework specifically addressing role-relevance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Broadly, consumerism can be considered as a set of beliefs and values integrated into, but not exclusive to, the global market system, intended to make people believe that happiness is best achieved through possessions. In literature there are several other definitions of consumerism, consumption, anti-consumption and consumption communities. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is to (i) present an overview of the research concepts, models and main theories of this topic, based on a systematic literature review and using the following databases to search information: Elsevier, Emerald, Science Direct, {EBSCO}, Springer, and {ISI} web knowledge; (ii) formulate a framework of consumption waves and anti-consumption motivations and types (iii) discuss consumption and anti-consumerism in football (soccer) context. The current study also carried out semi-structured interviews with 15 football fans with an average duration of 60 minutes each. Findings revealed four main types of anti-consumption: Global impact consumers or anti-consumption society; Selective consumption or anti-loyalists market activists; Conservative or Simplifiers; and Rejection of brand hegemony. Football fans are avid consumers of many products, such as information, knowledge, travels, tickets to matches, and diverse merchandizing from brands that sponsor the team and the club. Nevertheless, they are also selective consumers, rejecting everything connected to the rival clubs. Finally, the chapter provides insights for further research and managerial implications. In this vein, this chapter contributes to the existing literature giving insights for a better understanding of football clubs and fans as consumers and anti-consumers. © 2014, {IGI} Global.

In the present study we review all three dimensions of {CI} (i.e., innate innovativeness, domain specific innovativeness, and innovative behavior) from three different perspectives (i.e., generalist, particularist, and integrator). This review will provide insights about how these dimensions are interrelated and predict new product adoption behavior. The results provide propositions for future exploration of {CI} with a basic conceptual model. © 2014 Copyright © Taylor \& Francis Group, {LLC}.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Service innovation in networks ({SIIN}) is of utmost importance particularly to business-to-business firms for their profitability, growth and long-term competitive advantage. This paper aims to investigate several critical aspects of extant {SIIN} research: its current state, theoretical standpoints, determinants, and outcomes. Based on the findings, implications for business-to-business service innovation research are drawn. Design/methodology/approach: This is a systematic literature review. Extant publications were located from large electronic databases, analyzed, and the findings have been compiled to answer the predefined questions. Findings: The paper illustrates the overall state of extant {SIIN} research and presents its major topics. It reveals the six key theoretical perspectives that have been applied in {SIIN} studies. Determinants that affect {SIIN}, as well as its potential positive and negative outcomes, are shown. In addition, gaps in the existing knowledge-base have been identified and have led to the laying out of paths for future research. Research limitations/implications: The review does not cover publications that were unavailable in the electronic databases employed, or were not written in English. However, the succinct presentation of accessible knowledge provides multidimensional theoretical understandings as well as empirical insights into {SIIN} research. Practical implications: Managers may benefit from this study by understanding the determinants that they may influence, and the potential changes that may accompany the positive and negative outcomes of {SIIN}. Originality/value: The analytical review provides a concise synopsis of existing knowledge on service innovation in networks, and discusses its implications for business-to-business research and firms, which will be of interest to both academics and practitioners. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The results of a systematic review of business model literature are presented and utilise both the citation counts and the h-index to objectively demonstrate the limited engagement that the marketing discipline has had with business model literature, and the limited degree that the discipline has influenced that literature. The key findings reveal a growing, but formative body of literature that, hitherto, has been dominated by non-marketing disciplines and which has only just begun to be addressed by present day marketing scholars. Using the most influential articles identified in the analysis, the paper concludes with a case for the empirical development of the business model concept with industrial marketing scholarship. Such development is argued to be grounded in the potential of open business models, co-created with multiple stakeholders in a supply chain and the end users of a value proposition. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

This analysis seeks to explore the current market trends linked to cardiac stents in the United States. We utilized both a systematic literature review and a nationally representative data set (the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample) in an attempt to report the current trends of cardiovascular market. Results revealed an increase in coronary revascularization procedure and a correlating decrease in coronary artery bypass graft surgery ({CABG}) discharges. Although the medical device industry has shown growth and stability over the past decade, the true cost effectiveness of many of its products, including drug eluting stent ({DES}) vs. bare metal stent ({BMS}) vs. biodegradable stents, remains difficult to evaluate. Demographic characteristics will increase the overall use of stents while the challenges (e.g. new taxes) that the medical device industry faces in the context of the Affordable Care Act ({ACA}) of 2010 remain in question. Few research efforts have offered probable solutions to these obstacles, but their effectiveness has yet to be proven. © The Author(s) 2011 Reprints and permissions.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In light of the growth of internet usage and its important role in the field of e-commerce, electronic word-of-mouth ({eWOM}) has been changing people's behavior and decisions. People count on other users' opinions and information; they sometimes even make offline decisions based on information acquired online. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualise {eWOM} activity from an input-process-output ({IPO}) perspective; propose a classification framework based on the identified academic literature; analyze {eWOM} literature in terms of quantitative development and qualitative issues that are useful to both academics and researchers; and provide directions and guidelines for future research studies in {eWOM}. Design/methodology/approach: The authors performed a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed published journal articles and examined the current state of knowledge on {eWOM} literature based on a comprehensive search of several leading databases. In total, 94 articles were identified that comprised contributions from different strands of {eWOM} research. The scope of this investigation was limited to the timeframe of 2000-2009. Findings: The present study finds that research in {eWOM} is relatively new and has evolved only during the last ten years. This ten-year study is deemed to be representative of the available {eWOM} literature. It is also shown that many scholars have incorporated established theories to explain {eWOM} communication phenomena. The current study not only fills the current gap in {eWOM} research but also provides a roadmap in analyzing {eWOM} communications. Practical implications: This study serves as a consolidated database that may be used to guide future research. It provides a structured approach to analyzing the literature and identifying trends and gaps in order to map out an appropriate agenda for {eWOM} research. The proposed integrated classification framework can serve as a roadmap for academic research. Originality/value: This paper systematically reviews the current state of {eWOM} research. To contribute to the development of a more comprehensive database for {eWOM} research, a classification framework of the {eWOM} literature is presented, building on the {IPO} model, by summarizing and organizing prior research into three areas covering antecedents, processes, and consequences of {eWOM}. The authors further summarize the theories and models that previous scholars have applied to their studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into how branding is used in an innovative manner, when looking to generate equity and strengthen stakeholder relations - by a global car manufacturing company, governed by Iranian Islamic law. Following this, suggested areas of discussion are offered, in the interests of stimulating new thinking and further knowledge - surrounding marketing and branding in a Muslim context; Iranian culture; and the differences between Arab and Persian-centric approaches, towards an adherence to Islamic ethic. Design/methodology/approach: Inductive reasoning and syllogisms, as a basis for conceptual metaphor theory and critical discourse analysis. Evidence was gathered via in-depth interviews, personal observations and experiences; as a result of meetings and the in-house training of senior decision makers, over a three-year period. This is further supported by anecdotal evidence; systematic literature reviews; and existing empirical data. Findings: In the face of strict regulations from the Iranian Government, Iranian religious clergy and wider socio-political factors, the Saipa Group has developed an innovative approach to generate commercial gains and brand equity. This has been achieved through a brand-extension strategy, which seeks to engage a wide spectrum of stakeholders, through activities which permeate their working and social lives. From this, a platform is created which enables Saipa to market their core offering of vehicles. Originality/value: Currently, there exists little academic material examining marketing theory, within the context of organisations seeking to comply with Islamic law and Muslim customs. Furthermore, analysis which is reflective of examining the nuances among different Muslim nations remains scarce. To this end, the following case attempts to highlight and address some of these issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review current literature and practices concerning the usage and consumption of Halal, within marketing and branding. Following this, the paper is to both stimulate discussions and encourage further thinking within this field. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses inductive reasoning and syllogisms, as a basis for conceptual metaphor theory and critical discourse analysis. Evidence gathered from structured and systematic literature reviews - supported by existing empirical data, anecdotal evidence, personal observations and experience is also used. Findings: In business, the doctrine of what is Halal, has culminated in the creation of ingredient brands and in some cases forms of co-branding. However, the Halal's full potential has yet to be harnessed and there remain areas of dissonance and misunderstanding. Reasons offered by the authors are that current applications of brand theory unnecessarily restrict the term Halal and presuppose that there is one interpretation of its meaning. Also, instead of current trends which focus on rate determining steps within functional marketing approaches per se, Halal's competitive advantage is of more significance when delivered via the tacit elements of strategy and management. Research limitations/implications: As a conceptual paper, research is limited at times by a lack of empirical data and attempts necessitating the exploration of wide-ranging cross-disciplinary sources and stakeholder engagements. Originality/value: Growing market interest suggests its significance to both Muslims and non-Muslims. Furthermore, whilst research reveals studies looking at "meat and money" (Halal meat and Islamic finance) centred on functional attributes and monolithic consumption, few explore Halal's figurative and brand elements amongst diverse audiences. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},
