Experts’ reviews shape consumer’s preferences and purchase decisions because they are often perceived as unbiased and trustworthy. Wine industry is a high value agricultural industry from the perspectives of both the main raw agricultural and the value added in the finished products. As a high value industry to both governments and consumers, countries spend billions on marketing their agricultural industries to not only their own citizens but also foreign citizens all over the world including these experts to establish a good product reputation. This paper examines the role of country of origin in expert eWOM (ratings and reviews) through large dataset from the global wine industry. Furthermore, we processed the review content by applying a structured automated text analysis program Diction. The result of ANOVA test demonstrates that there are significant differences between countries in terms of price, rating, and all the Diction content dimensions at the p\xa0&amp;lt;\xa00.001. We also find significant effects on wine quality ratings of price, country of origin, and review of content by conducting regression analysis. Indicated by the size of effect on ratings, expert reviewers use price as signal of quality when they provide eWOM. Country image significantly influences their review in most cases exception of Australia and France. USA variable is non-significant when considered alone but is significant when considered with price. France variable is non-significant with price included in the regression but has a significant bonus in ratings when not considering the effect of price. The Australia variable was non-significant in all regression analysis indicating that there was Australian wine ratings were not statistically different than minor wine producing countries. This paper provides several contributions in the field of expert eWOM and country of origin literatures. Wine producer in prestigious wine producing countries such as Germany and Italy can extract a price premium related to the country that is perceived by expert as high quality. However, producers in less prestigious wine producing countries (e.g., South African or Chilean) can signal quality through a higher price that can help them overcome the country image bias and aid the perception by experts of high quality, and they can also take advantage of the low price segment of consumers. Producers can also manage expert eWOM by priming these reviewers to use more active, certain, optimistic language in reviews to increase quality ratings. Furthermore, governments and industry associations can encourage experts to writes reviews with active, optimistic and central language to have an influence on quality rating, and thus develop country images.. eWOM bias Expert reviews Intext-mining Wine&#x27;, &#x27;Sponsorship Research: Drawing on the Past to Shape the Future of Sponsorship. This study examines how scholarly research on sponsorship has evolved between 1980 and July 2012. While various scholars (e.g., Cornwell and Maignan 1998; Pope 1998; Walliser 2003) have documented the progress of sponsorship research previously, this review departs from existing perspectives and redirects the conversation in the sponsorship literature by focusing attention on the semantic relationships among sponsorship concepts and the ways in which they have changed over time. Using Leximancer text-analysis software, we explore the emergence and growth of ideas and topics in sponsorship research by undertaking a systematic analysis of ideological trends. The research objectives of this study are: (1) to identify the scholarly trends through an empirical assessment of research across the history of sponsorship; and (2) based on the trends identified, to shape the future of sponsorship research. We collected titles and abstracts of articles in sponsorship presented in scholarly journals to July 2012. Guided by previous authors, we focused specifically on sourcing abstracts since abstracts encapsulate a concise summary of an article’s core issues and are therefore lexically dense (Cretchley et al. 2010). We sourced abstracts for our analyses from multiple databases (e.g., ISI Web of Science, Scopus, EconPapers (RePEc), PsycINFO and Google Scholar) and from over 150 marketing journals. We included abstracts from journals in languages other than English where English translations of the abstract were available electronically (Walliser 2003). In total, we collected 804 articles published across 144 scholarly journals. Next, we created subsets of the data in 10-year periods (1980-1989, 1990-1999, and 2000-2009), and one for 2010-2012. Using Leximancer software (Version 4.0), we produced a set of concept maps and reports showing semantic structures across the history of sponsorship for each of the four periods (see Smith and Humphreys 2006). The concept map of the entire corpus of abstracts revealed a core set of concepts that are recurrent and quite evenly distributed throughout the history of sponsorship. Sponsorship, marketing, objectives, value, strategy, companies, important, and key are concepts central to sponsorship’s intellectual identity. We identified two primal opposing but complementary forces around sponsorship measurement (e.g., consumers, awareness, brand, effects, image, impact, media, advertising) and sponsorship management (e.g., industry, benefits, rights, business, organizations, management, development, financial). Based on examination of the prominent concepts within each period, we defined the 1980s as the Intellectual Era (television, important, business, benefits, and advertising); the 1990s as the Ambushing Era (objectives, ambush, support, major, and corporate); the 2000s as the Consumer Era (products, financial, media, role, and market); and as the 2010s as the Relationships Era (professional, team, relationship, social and value). In the decade 2010-2019, we expect to observe the development and empirical exploration of more managerially focused models of sponsorship that center on better understanding the development of sponsorship strategy and the extraction of value from sponsorship investment. Going forward, the integration of social media as a sponsorship-marketing tool could also define a new era of research. In brief, adding a new data set to earlier reflections on sponsorship deepens our understanding of the role that key concepts and their inter-relationships have played in shaping sponsorship scholarship to date. We strongly believe the current study lends a high level of credibility to our insights about sponsorship’s past that can richly inform discussions about the future directions of sponsorship research.. Multiple Database Scholarly Journal Scholarly Research Semantic Relationship Semantic Structure&#x27;, &#x27;Ambush Marketing of the London Olympics: A Content Analysis. Global sporting events such as the Olympic Games attract significant amounts of sponsorship spend by companies that want to position their brands with such a high profile event. There are very few events that can achieve this on a truly global scale, but the Olympic Games are one of these events. However, it is also the case that these types of events attract ambush marketing as rival companies seek to have their brands associated with the Olympics, but at only a fraction of the cost. Ambush marketing has been termed associative marketing as the ambush marketer attempts to associate the brand with and event and trade off the goodwill associated with the event. Thus ambush marketing attempts to confuse the consumer into believing that the ambusher is a sponsor. Ambush marketing strategies include sponsoring media coverage of an event, sponsoring a sub-category of the event, consumer promotions, congratulatory messages, pourage agreements and corporate hospitality. However, Burton and Chadwick (2009) say ambush marketing has evolved, from mainly broadcast sponsorship campaigns and advertising at the events, to more creative and associative marketing efforts away from the event, to the use of spectators or fans to promote the brand. Although ambush marketing of such an event is not necessarily new, the 2012 London Olympics presented an intriguing research scenario because firstly it had the strictest anti-ambush legislation and enforcement policies of any other previous Games. In an attempt to protect the extensive sponsorship spend (in excess of £3.7 billion) required to host the London Olympic Games, a total of 24 statutory instruments and five acts of Parliament were brought into being including bans on the use of numerous words associated with the Olympics, including ‘Games’, ‘2012’ and combinations of ‘Gold’, ‘Summer’, ‘Medals’, ‘safe zones’ where sponsors have sole rights and aggressive onsite policing. Ambush marketing is no longer just a civil matter but a criminal one. Such strict control measures had the potential to both alienate the public as well as lull the sponsors into a false sense of security. The second aspect making the London Olympics an interesting research event was the strong social media presence. These Games were even described as the ‘digital games’. This paper looks at how effective this legislation was in practice given the strong social media presence, by undertaking a content analysis on text extracted from Google using the key word search term ‘london olympics ambush marketing’. A search was done every day for a month before, and the time during the Olympics. For each period all the articles were then combined into a single word document. A total of 406 354 words (1108 pages) were included in the data set for the ‘before’ period and 413 433 words (1008 pages) in the ‘during’ set. Leximancer, text mining software used to analyse (thematically and semantically) the content of textual documents and produce conceptual maps, was used for the data analysis. The Leximancer maps revealed that in the ‘month before’ analysis the main themes exhibit a strong focus on the highly regulated nature of the London Olympics and the extreme lengths that the IOC and LOCOG’s have gone to protect the official sponsors. The main themes during the Olympics while still emphasising the measures in place to protect the official sponsors, revealed an emergence of more discussion on the ambushers, with Nike and Dr Dre featuring prominently. Both these ambushers appear to have tiptoed around the IOC and LOCOG legislation and rules. The role of social media is highlighted. Comparing the data from the two periods, the research findings suggest that the legislation did curtail ambush marketing to some extent, although did not eliminate it. Despite concerns about a backlash from spectators and the possibility of negative publicity due to the strict controls, this did not appear to materialise. Furthermore, the nature of ambush marketing seems to have changed from a direct assault on the event, to more subtle ambushing techniques, also more difficult to predict. The hype surrounding the London Games as the ‘first truly’ digital Games, with the anticipated mass use of Social Media as an ambush medium of the Games did not materialise. This may have been due to the cooperation of the leading Social Media sites with Facebook banning advertising associated with the Games during the Olympics. Similarly, Twitter announced a ban any potential ambush tweets. The concept maps did pick up the theme of media for both before and during the Games with the central concept in both periods relating to Social Media. It is difficult to tell how effective the Games were for the official sponsors in terms of raising the profile of their brands. Only four brands were picked up by the concept maps, two official sponsors (Adidas and Coca Cola) and two unofficial sponsors (Nike and Beats). It would seem that sponsoring the Games does not get everyone talking about your brand. Limitations in this research are acknowledged..

An Abstract. Online product reviews have become the single, largest depository of supplementary information that customers use in their product search, evaluation, and purchase process. The innate value of online reviews lays in the valuable information they provide to prospective customers in their decision making. This has inspired researchers to identify the characteristics of helpful reviews. Extent research suggests that helpful reviews are often of certain numeric features, such as lengthy details and unequivocal rating (Karimi and Wang 2017; Mudambi and Schuff 2010). However, these numeric features do not reveal the nature of the review content. Recognizing the importance of review content, recent studies gear toward examining review content, with a focus on sentiment, using text analysis techniques (Cao et al. 2011; Salehan and Kim 2016). Apart from sentiment, the impact of other content characteristics of online reviews is largely unknown. This research explores online review content by decomposing and comparing three fundamental information components that a review may contain: sensory information (i.e., reviewer’s observation), cognitive information (i.e., thoughts/analysis), and affective information (i.e., emotions). These components are directly associated with three fundamental psychological processes (observation, thinking, and emotion) that people experience to interact with and make sense of the world. When writing a review, reviewers tangle various types of information together to construct narratives and express opinions, creating a complex review content. Readers, on the other side, retrieve and evaluate the information of all types to form an opinion on the quality and helpfulness of the review. Distinguishing these different information components and analyzing their direct and combined effects can significantly enhance our knowledge of consumer’s information needs and online search behavior. This research performs text analysis to capture the three types of information in online product reviews, analyze their patterns and effects on perceived information value. Results from analyzing a sample of 56,752 reviews from Amazon.com indicate that sensory information in online review content has a significantly positive effect on online review helpfulness; whereas, this effect is insignificant for cognitive information, and significantly negative for affective information. This indicates that review readers highly value reviewer’s observations and their expression of sensory experience, are indifferent toward reviewer’s thoughts and analysis, and dislike expression of emotions in review content. This pattern is more salient in reviews of search goods than those of experience goods..

Using the most effective movie advertising tool, studios release trailers early in advance aiming to build heavy pre-release buzz which will in turn drive audiences to the cinema on the opening weekend. While pre-release movie buzz has proved to be instrumental in influencing box office performance, most electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) research on movies is limited to the quantitative measurement of WOM metrics (e.g. volume, valence) (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2015; Liu, 2006), overlooking other significant information that could offer insight on early audience perceptions. Very recent research on the antecedents of movie WOM has identified that the combination of liking the trailer along with understanding what the movie is about increases the likelihood of viewers engaging in favourable pre-release WOM and in paying to see the movie at the cinema (Archer-Brown et al,. 2017). Focusing on the concept of understanding, this work-in-progress aims to investigate the mechanisms through which consumers draw inferences and eventually form perceptions on upcoming movies when viewing trailers. Approximately seven million data points on wide-release movies have been collected from Twitter and YouTube since November 2015. Content analysis will be performed on the data through automated natural language processing techniques, where networks of words will be drawn as an innovative way to visualise user-generated content. Early results on the analysis of three movies suggest that viewers utilise different techniques in inference-making depending on prior knowledge about the movie. eWOM on sequel movies focuses on the appearance and on the prominence of characters, while WOM on true story adaptations is richer with debates on how events truly happened and with the provision of secondary sources of information. Finally, WOM on movies with original storylines suggests that viewers rely on heuristic cues\xa0– such as the stars’ and directors’ previous work or other same-genre movies\xa0– when trying to fill in missing information about the movie’s plot. This is the first part of an ongoing research project which eventually aims to construct a framework for classifying comprehensive trailers and identifying their relationship to favourable WOM and to box office performance. Theoretical contributions will be made towards advertising and WOM theory, by delving deeper into a newly added WOM antecedent. Managerial contributions include the design of effectively comprehensive promotional material as well as methodologies which can be adopted to gain insight on early audience perceptions.. NA&#x27;, &#x27;Differences in Online Review Content between Old and New Products: An Abstract. Online product reviews are one of the most important sources of information that influences the consumer decision making process. Studies have shown a positive relationship between online reviews and product sales. Not surprisingly, extant research has studied the factors that influence reviews such as include reviewer credibility and review content, review volume, valence, and dispersion, the impact of negative versus positive reviews, and the influence of product category. Despite the important influence of online reviews on consumer decision making, there are several key empirical and theoretical questions in the domain of online reviews that remain unanswered. Extensive research on online reviews has been taken place for movies, books, and television shows. There has been relatively limited research into reviews for new products in other, less well-known product categories. In addition, most research has focused on the volume, valence, and variance of reviews. Research investigating review content is emerging, although much of this research is based on standard attributes of the text using packages like LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count). Research investigating more specific aspects of review content is less prevalent. Finally, there have been several studies focused on the impact of online reviews on new products sales and review-based mining to get the pricing power of different attributes. However, these inquiries have not taken into consideration how reviews for new products differ from reviews for similar products that already exist and are available online. The aim of this paper is to compare content of online reviews for new and established products. We seek to understand how consumers evaluate old and new products in the same category based on online reviews and whether there are systematic differences in the type of content discussed for each type of product. We use Amazon review data from two categories to compare review content for a new product and the leading established product in each category. The present study serves as a pilot to examine the efficacy of machine-based coding of product reviews along a number of relevant dimensions and probe for potential differences to inform future research. We find that there is a difference in the way consumers review old and new products in a category. The reviews of new products are highly descriptive and detailed with experiences shared by the users. Additionally, when we look at the attribute-wise impact on the ratings, it is found that attributes that are common to both seem to have a higher impact on the ratings than attributes which stand out in the new products..

Under the shadow of the covid-19 pandemic, millions of young people have the resulting consequences (e.g., increased uncertainty regarding their careers and economic prospects: McGrindle, 2020; Yuesti et al., 2020) started to think more seriously about how to manage their financial resources. As a result, personal finance has become trendy to speak about. Rather than proactive actions coming through the formal financial services industry to address the increasing demand for accessible financial information that does not require an advisor or costs a fortune, we are witnessing the uprising of personal finance influencers. These financial influencers (a.k.a. Finfluencers) talk about how to manage various aspects of financial life and do so by promoting their advice on a broad scope of money related topics (ranging from dealing with student loans, buying a house, how to ask for a pay raise, budgeting tips, and tricks, filing for tax returns, stock investment opportunities, and portfolio management) in short, light-hearted video formats that are posted on Instagram, Tiktok, YouTube and other social media platforms. Although currently, these Finfluencers can be regarded as a niche influencer marketing group, it is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years – especially now that designated sections on social media platforms are taking off (e.g., #FinTok, #FinTwit, #Finmeme, #StockTok, #Findependence). In line with this trend, this research explores how consumers consume social media influencers when they offer utilitarian (rather than hedonic) oriented products, services, and advice. Using text-mining techniques, we examine the content of personal finance influencers on Instagram to investigate how consumers respond to the recommendation of more utilitarian-oriented products. In addition, gender and race are an integral part of the consumer’s perception of financial expertise. This research looks at the moderating role of gender and race on influencers’ financial expertise on consumer response. We found that influencers with financial accreditations generate a more positive affective response compared with financial influencers who mainly share information stemming from personal experience. In addition, we found that influencers’ gender and race moderate the relationship between financial expertise and consumers’ affective responses significantly..

Influencer marketing utilizes influential online opinion leaders to disseminate brand related user-generated content and shape audience attitudes through social networking sites (Lim et al. 2017), is currently widely adopted by brands to effectively reach their target audiences (Evans et al. 2017). Despite many benefits of influencer marketing for brands, public policy concerns regarding the covert nature of paid brand endorsements that are masqueraded as unadulterated opinions have risen in the past years (Johnson et al. 2019). Sparking calls for transparency and disclosure of sponsorship information to facilitate the consumers’ ability to differentiate sponsored content from authentic (i.e., non-sponsored) product reviews and editorial content (Veirman and Hudders 2019). Recent guidelines and (self-)regulatory initiatives (e.g., ASA 2018; FTC 2017; IAB 2016) prescribe the disclosure of any commercial relationship between the influencer and the brand in their social media posts. Using automated text analysis (LIWC) on audio-visual branded content, this study explores the role and impact of sponsorship disclosure and message complexity on consumers’ responses. Findings suggest that message complexity and sponsorship disclosure can significantly affect consumers’ tone in their responses. Additionally, sponsorship disclosure significantly affects consumers’ clout. The results also reveal that different levels of message complexity resulted in different levels of consumers’ analytical thinking and clout when posts with or without sponsorship disclosure. This study makes several contributions to the further understanding of the function of disclosures in sponsored Instagram posts as a type of native advertising. The disclosure of sponsorship would generate more confidence for consumers, as it provides information for consumers to arrive at causal explanations for events. However, disclosure of sponsored messages also generates feelings of suspicion and deception for consumers. Our finding further supports previous findings suggesting sponsorship disclosure helps consumer recognize sponsored posts as advertising, and in turn reduce the effectiveness of the persuasive (Evans et al. 2017; Boerman et al. 2017). Moreover, mediums with different levels of message complexity result in different clout levels. Consumers from video posts appeared to have more confidence and a sense of social status because compare with photos, videos provided involve them in a dynamic environment and provide more comprehensive storylines.. Influencer marketing LIWC Message complexity Sponsorship Disclosure&#x27;, &#x27;Consumer Engagement in Influencer Marketing Video Campaigns: An Abstract. The amount of videos users watch on social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, has almost doubled since 2018 (Hayes, 2022). In marketing, videos are an increasingly successful means for brand to engage with consumers, with several studies finding that video content leads to more consumer engagement (i.e., liking, commenting, or sharing) than text content, which affects brand attitudes and purchase intentions (e.g., Li &amp; Xie, 2020). Social media influencers generate a significant amount of video content online, while many brands spend at least 10% of their yearly marketing budget on influencer marketing (Geyser, 2021). However, there is a gap in research investigating the key characteristics in influencer posts that lead to engagement, particularly when it comes to video rather than textual content. In short, there is a need for more understanding about how best to design video content that engages customers. With this in mind, we explore how video characteristics in influencer marketing campaigns affect consumer engagement (in the form of liking and commenting). Specifically, we ask: (1) how emotional facial expressions in video content, and (2) corresponding post descriptions (i.e., textual cues) affect consumer engagement with influencers’ social media posts. To answer our research questions, we collected 2,376 social media posts from Instagram that were published from 1,240 influencers in partnership with 145 brands across ten product categories, such as apparel, beauty, and technology. All videos were analysed using Schwenzow et al.’s (2020) video tool that enables researchers to analyse a broad range of video characteristics on a large scale. The post descriptions were analysed with Language Inquiry Word Count (LIWC-22). LIWC is a text-analytics software (Tausczik &amp; Pennebaker, 2010) that uses dictionaries to calculate the degree to which each piece of text contains specific category words, such as first-person pronouns or emotional words (e.g., happy, cried, nice, ugly). Our results show that, compared to neutral facial expressions, emotional facial expressions in the video are negatively associated with engagement. On the contrary, we find that emotionality in the post description is positively associated with engagement. Finally, our findings suggest a significant moderation effect of product category (hedonic vs. utilitarian) on the relationship between emotionality in the post description and engagement. Theoretically, drawing on an interplay of theories including emotional contagion theory and heuristic-systematic model of information processing, we shed light on the nature of the relationship between social media post characteristics and consumer engagement in an influencer context. Practically, we provide advice on how a popular form of marketing content, video, can be used in an increasingly popular marketing context; influencer marketing..

Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory study is to propose a new methodological approach to investigate brand associations. More specifically, the study aims to show how brand associations can be identified and analysed in an online community of international consumers of fashion to determine the degree of matching with company-defined brand associations. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is two-pronged, integrating qualitative market research techniques with quantitative text mining. It was applied to determine types and perceptions of brand associations among fashion bloggers with reference to three leading Italian fashion houses. These were then compared to brand associations found in company-generated texts to measure the degree of matching. Findings: The results showed consistent brand associations across the three brands, as well as substantial matching with company-defined brand associations. In addition, the analysis revealed the presence of distinctive brand association themes that shed further light on how brand attributes were perceived by blog participants. Practical implications: The methods described can be used by managers to identify and reinforce favourable brand associations among consumers. This knowledge can then be applied towards developing and implementing effective brand strategies. Originality/value: The authors propose an interdisciplinary approach to investigate brand associations in online communities. It incorporates text mining and computer-assisted textual analysis as techniques borrowed from the field of linguistics which have thus far seen little application in marketing studies, but can nonetheless provide important insights for strategic brand management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited..

Building a sustainable brand image for a luxury fashion company is a very complex and tangled marketing process. Brand image is a set of perceptions and beliefs surrounding a particular brand fixed in the mind of the consumer. It represents the result of the associations that the consumer recognizes in a brand and summarizes the positioning, personality and reputation of the brand itself. Companies can derive fundamental insights by analysing the associations and how they are formed and, in particular, whether they are related to their positioning choices. In the luxury fashion business, brand image communication is often delegated to offline events to convey specific values, ideals and messages to consumers and build brand associations. The Salvatore Ferragamo Museum, in particular, with its &quot;Sustainable Thinking&quot; exhibition, is seen as the emblem of this vision, the goal of which is to deliver a specific concept of a sustainable brand image to its customers. The objective of this empirical research was to seek correspondences or discrepancies between consumer brand perceptions and the identity conveyed by the Ferragamo brand in terms of sustainability. By using a netnographic and text mining methodology we found that the consumer associates the brand with a company committed to the environment and involved in social issues; a company that traditionally shows creative and experimental skills, using unusual materials, artisanry, innovative techniques and unique designs. The image that the company wants to convey, however, also includes other characterizations. Specifically, the company considers the &quot;Made in Italy&quot; aspect, the importance of its history and its family identity as decisive associations. These are all elements that, as far as this survey is concerned, were not found in the consumer perspective. As a result, from the comparison between the brand associations of both subjects, gaps emerge on which the company must intervene by designing new communication strategies or correcting existing ones in order to improve brand image and the overall brand value in terms of sustainability..

The rise of social media has provided firms with ample new opportunities to communicate their brands (Carlson et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2018). Additionally, because textual and audio-visual data on social media platforms can be preserved, the medium has become a valuable tool for providing insights and informing strategic brand management (Kim et al. 2019; Greco and Polli 2019). Within the overall social media communication environment, brand communities specifically provide unique insights, as they can enhance understanding regarding changes in consumer’s opinions and feeling and how they perceive and talk to each other about a brand (Kim and Lee 2019). Using automated text analysis and Berthon and his colleagues’ (2009) framework to classify the user-generated brand content, this study investigates consumer attitudes towards luxury products based on the online communication within a Facebook brand community. This study includes a sample size of 15,014 comments from 302 posts from a Facebook luxury fashion group. The analysis revealed several significant main and interaction effects. This included significant main effects of aesthetics on analytic thinking and tone. More importantly, a significant two-way interaction between aesthetic and ontology occurred on analytic thinking and tone. The study provides useful and interesting insights into the theory and practice of luxury branding. For marketers bringing luxury to the masses could ensure higher sales, however, the perceived loss of exclusivity experienced by the high aesthetic customers could negatively impact the brand’s image in the long run. Luxury brands could mitigate these negative feelings and fuel prolonged consumer engagement by providing other options that make this part of their target audience feel special. Since the high aesthetic consumers are generally well informed about a company’s products or services, brands should consider selecting these individuals for co-creation and product innovation design purposes. This will not only help in re-building the consumer-brand relationship but because of their status within the social group will likely add to enhanced positive social discourse. This work also adds to the luxury fashion literature by incorporating linguistic inquiry and word count as a research tool to investigating luxury brand discourse in online brand communities, confirming the influence of the social context and conclusions by Berthon et al. (2009) that multiple market segments for one luxury brand exist and that marketing strategies should be focused accordingly.. eWOM LIWC Luxury branding Social media&#x27;]

Through the years, a great deal of research had been dedicated to understanding how consumers think, feel, and behave in the marketplace. From its early development to the present, consumer researchers have adopted different methods and followed different approaches to describe the consumption phenomena. By pursuing a probabilistic approach, the current study aims to provide in-depth insight into consumer behavior research&#x27;s evolution and transformation between 1980 and 2020. The results exhibit a strong increase on subjects like consumer trust, self-identity, digital consumption, social media engagement, consumer culture theory, consumer motivation, and brand-consumer relationships. The citation analysis shows the most impactful articles and topics in consumer behavior research. The results indicate that articles on customer service satisfaction, experiential consumption, consumer trust, digital consumption, and social media engagement tend are heavily cited. And to understand each journals contribution an analysis based on citations, journal impact and topical diversity is also included. The study also includes the possible research directions for the future of consumer behavior.. consumer behavior consumer research consumption studies data visualization Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) text mining topic modeling&quot;, &#x27;A Scientometric Analysis of Publications in the Journal of Business-to-Business Marketing 1993–2014. ABSTRACT: Purpose: To conduct a scientometric analysis of the contents of the Journal of Business-to-Business Marketing from 1993 to 2014. Methodology/approach: The authors use the Leximancer computer-aided text analysis program, which reliably and reproducibly identifies the main concepts embedded in the text—their frequency and patterns of co-occurrence—based on the ways words move together in the text. They also identify key concepts that differentiate among the networks of concepts occurring in each of the first four five-year periods of the Journal’s history. Findings: There are four common underlying conceptual themes: relationships, market, study, and business. But the focal mix of concepts has changed over time, from a narrower initial focus on distribution and power and conflict, to a greater focus on firm business marketing strategy and pedagogy, to a focus on networks, the Internet and more collaborative relations, to a focus, in the most recent period, on psycho-social network concepts, such as trust and commitment. Research implications: The results complement and provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing researcher-conducted literature reviews of business marketing and JBBM’s contributions. The methodology provides possibilities for further analysis as it can be extended to analyze the business marketing and wider marketing literature more generally and how it has evolved. Practical implications: Leximancer provides a comprehensive, accessible summary of the content of the JBBM and demonstrates its value as a text analysis program. Originality/value/contribution: The authors are among the first to use this novel computer text analysis program to conduct a scientometric analyses of journal content. It provides a template for conducting studies of other journals and text.. business marketing evolution of business concepts Journal of Business-to-Business Marketing Leximancer relationships scientometric text analysis&#x27;, &#x27;An Exploratory Analysis of Consumer Opinions, Ethics, and Sentiment of Neuromarketing: An Abstract. Neuromarketing can be defined as both an innovative research methodology that makes use of neuroscience techniques and as field of study that merges marketing principles and neuroscience theory. As a research methodology, neuromarketing has the potential to detect unconscious processes and activities that are difficult to access through traditional advertising research methods. As a field of study, neuromarketing refers to a link between neuroscience theory (and methods) and marketing techniques. The emergence of neuromarketing as a new field of study has created ethical concerns about the use and misuse of neuroscience technologies, under the premise of advancing the understanding of consumer behavior. The ethical issues concerning neuromarketing research suggest that consumers need more information about neuromarketing in order to understand its implications and to protect themselves from the negligent research behaviors of companies. Thus, taking into consideration the relevant role of consumers in neuromarketing as both participants of the experiments and final recipients of the “benefits” derived from firms’ marketing decisions, an understanding of what consumers think about neuromarketing becomes critical. To examine consumer opinions, a content analysis of neuromarketing blogs and social media sites was selected as the exploratory method to uncover the “voice” of consumers about neuromarketing. Three text-analytics techniques were used to examine the texts, namely, word frequency analysis, story network analysis, and sentiment analysis. The implications of this content analysis of neuromarketing texts from blogs and social media are twofold. First, the three-step methodology used for the analysis of texts represents a helpful tool for marketers and demonstrates the importance of user-generated content (UGC) as a valuable source of consumer information. Conventional wisdom suggests that listening to what customers say and where they are saying it, can help a firm make decisions regarding their brands, products, and services. Marketers must recognize that more effort has to be allocated to social media observation and the analysis of the data provided through these sites. Second, the findings of this research represent the “voice” of consumers regarding the emerging field of neuromarketing. This exploratory study can help neuromarketing research firms, scientists, academics, and marketers understand consumer perceptions, feelings, and attitudes toward neuromarketing. Specifically, this research makes evident that consumer sentiment of neuromarketing is mostly positive; however, some concerns regarding the ethical use of the method still need to be addressed. Therefore, it is critical that government, companies, neuromarketing firms, researchers, and consumer advocacy organizations work together in the creation of regulations, standards, and a code of ethics for neuromarketing..

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate customers’ experiences with Airbnb by text-mining customer reviews posted on the platform and comparing the extracted topics from online reviews between Airbnb and the traditional hotel industry using topic modeling. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses text-mining approaches, including content analysis and topic modeling (latent Dirichlet allocation method), to examine 1,026,988 Airbnb guest reviews of 50,933 listings in seven cities in the USA. Findings: The content analysis shows that negative reviews are more authentic and credible than positive reviews on Airbnb and that the occurrence of social words is positively related to positive emotion in reviews, but negatively related to negative emotion in reviews. A comparison of reviews on Airbnb and hotel reviews shows unique topics on Airbnb, namely, “late check-in”, “patio and deck view”, “food in kitchen”, “help from host”, “door lock/key”, “sleep/bed condition” and “host response”. Research limitations/implications: The topic modeling result suggests that Airbnb guests want to get to know and connect with the local community; thus, help from hosts on ways they can authentically experience the local community would be beneficial. In addition, the results suggest that customers emphasize their interaction with hosts; thus, to improve customer satisfaction, Airbnb hosts should interact with guests and respond to guests’ inquiries quickly. Practical implications: Hotel managers should design marketing programs that fulfill customers’ desire for authentic and local experiences. The results also suggest that peer-to-peer accommodation platforms should improve online review systems to facilitate authentic reviews and help guests have a smooth check-in process. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine consumer reviews in detail in the sharing economy and compare topics from consumer reviews between Airbnb and hotels.. Airbnb Consumer reviews Sharing economy Text-mining Topic modelling&#x27;, &#x27;Know your guests’ preferences before they arrive at your hotel: evidence from TripAdvisor. Purpose: Toward achieving a better guest experience, the current study aims to use the word frequency comparison technique to evaluate the types of attributes and services that are used most frequently in guests’ five- and one-star reviews on TripAdvisor. The working-paper also aims to investigate the differences between reviews written by men and women. Design/methodology/approach: A combined sentiment and text analysis was applied to 329,849 UK hotel reviews from UK TripAdvisor to identify factors that influence customer satisfaction, including those with gender differences. Findings: The present findings reveal important differences between the male- and female-produced terms. The results show that female travelers pay more attention to the hotel’s core products and their comfort compared to male travelers. In terms of food and beverage, men’s comments tended to focus on pubs, beer and certain types of food. In contrast, women’s comments were more likely to be related to healthy eating, such as homemade, vegan and vegetarian foods, as well as fruits and healthy breakfasts. Women also pay more attention to the soft skills of staff such as friendliness, helpfulness and welcoming messages. Practical implications: While core attributes of a hotel stay remain crucial for all guests, disparities exist between the language men and women use to describe them. For core products, women pay more attention to the room’s cleanliness, comfort and features such as bed, pillow, blanket, towel, toiletries and decoration, whereas men pay more attention to the layout, size and type of room. Hotels may use gender as a segmentation variable and use these findings in their marketing campaigns. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies offering insights into the differences between the male and female reactions to and preferences for hotel services at a national level. Following a novel method, this study has listed and ranked attributes and differentiated them based on gender.. Gender Guest experience Hotel industry Online reviews TripAdvisor&#x27;, &#x27;Do they Expect Differently in Hotel Experiences? Views of Eastern vs. Western: An Abstract. This study sheds light on ways online guests’ rating in the hotel review website TripAdvisor differ between Chinese- and English-speaking groups. The study adopted mixed methodology and applied with both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The dual analysis with 800 online reviews of eight hotel brands that considered as a representative of its category located in Bangkok city, Thailand. Results from quantitative analysis revealed that 2-star hotels were rated positively than 3- to 5-star hotels. English-speaking guests gave higher ratings than Chinese-speaking guest in all the hotel service attributes (e.g. Service, Cleanliness, Room, Sleep Quality, Location, Value, and Overall). From qualitative aspect, ten service attributes that impacted on traveler satisfaction were identified. These attributes were then classified into three broad themed categories known as Intangible Service, Tangible Service and Staying Experience. The result further reveals the most frequently used words when cross-cultural travelers give online reviews on the sites. Implications of the divergences in themes abstracted are discussed. The current research offers practical insights for hotel operators who would like to improve their service quality. More online reviews on the hotels’ webs is better for the hotel performance since those online reviews can be considered as good references for the travelers during their searching process. Positive reviews mean satisfaction and positively influence on consumer purchase decision while negative reviews consider as a gift for hoteliers for further development their service standard. In this case, the hotelier could consider developing the customer incentive system (e.g. membership rewards) to guests who post reviews of hotels products and services on the social media platforms, which plays an important role in eWOM for younger generation who prefers using social media platform rather than traditional WOM (Kim et al. 2016)..

The Role of Uses Gratifications and Privacy Concerns: An Abstract. Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVAs) are invading homes and workplaces all over the world. Continuance advancements and innovations with automation technologies such as Robotic Process Automation, Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing have boosted the global market of these devices. After first adoption, which could be fostered due to marketing and promotional campaigns and also users’ curiosity, the continuance usage of these tools is tremendously important to build a sustainable market and is therefore challenging for vendors. This article investigates the motivation to continue using these tools that could stem from the gratifications they afford to users. We are also interested in the constraints that hinder this behavior, especially privacy concerns, as IVAs are perceived as ‘open-ended’ and community-based devices (Ku et al. 2013). Building on three areas of research: information technology and information systems (IS/IT) continuance usage (Al-maghrabi et al. 2011; Zhou 2013), uses and gratifications theory (UGT) (Dolan et al. 2016; Ifinedo 2016) and privacy concerns (Ku et al. 2013; LaRose and Eastin 2002), we develop an original research model of IVAs continuance usage intention. Our focus will be put on home usage of IVAs, which excludes usage at professional settings (Burns and Igou 2019; Todorov et al. 2018). To test the model, an online survey is conducted within a sample of 258 IVAs’ users in France. Part least squared structural equation modeling is applied to analyze data. Results show that privacy concerns strongly and negatively affect continuance intention. This dependent construct is also positively and directly determined by subjective norms, perceived critical mass, and uses gratifications, i.e. utilitarian gratifications (social interactions and information seeking) and more significantly hedonic gratifications (entertainment and fashion). Besides, only subjective norms could be considered as antecedent factors to all our gratifications constructs. This study contributes to the literature on IVAs, UGT and privacy concerns. It also provides IVAs’ vendors with useful insights on how to retain their users.. Continuance intention to use Intelligent virtual assistant Privacy concerns Uses and gratifications theory&#x27;, &#x27;Opportunities and Challenges Facing AI Voice-Based Assistants: Consumer Perceptions and Technology Realities: An Abstract. Where AI has become especially pivotal for users’ interactions is in the case of voice-based assistants (VAs), such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. From what is initially perceived as being a tool to play music, read out news reports and set timers, VAs have developed considerably in recent years and their functionality goes way beyond initial perceptions. For example, Amazon Alexa will be able to give out health advice to users in the United Kingdom as health-related questions will be automatically searched for using the official NHS website (MIT Technology Review, 2020). Some reports go as far to discuss how Amazon has plans to be able to run someone’s entire life from the Alexa on the basis that the systems are getting so sophisticated and the data being collected is so vast that the Alexa will be capable of predicting needs (Hao, 2019). Nevertheless, users still appear to be resistant to use VAs, with some even reluctant to engage with this technology entirely (PwC, 2018). Most of these constraints to VA adoption primarily relate to lack of trust, perceived data privacy and security concerns and lack of knowledge or understanding. Despite the benefits and opportunities of AI software, it is inherently limited by capabilities surrounding planning, reasoning, knowledge, natural language processing, ability to move and to empathise. It is this lack of emotional connection that is a fundamental component of users being less trusting towards AI voice-based assistants. This research investigates the role of emerging capabilities, privacy concerns and trust towards VAs using a mixed-methodology design. Results from the qualitative element of the study reveal that it is more about trusting the capabilities and functionalities than being scared over personal data. This theme will subsequently be examined further in a follow-up experimental study to examine the role of context towards these perceptions. The focus of the experimental design will subsequently consider the direct relationship between perceived behavioural control and intention to continue to use VAs with consideration into the indirect effects of privacy concerns and trust and the moderating role of perceived capabilities. The findings, thus far, show how VAs, as new technologies and leaders of machine learning capabilities, can enhance customer experiences, improve customer relationships and add value to firms. As privacy concerns are often dismissed, if customers benefit from the sharing of their information, yet their capabilities being under-appreciated, firms can focus attention to the high-quality functions of these devices to encourage their more frequent use.. Artificial intelligence Privacy Trust Voice based assistants&#x27;, &#x27;Special Session: Corporate Social Responsibility and AI: The Case of Fashion: An Abstract. This paper critically examines the ethical issues of current and predicted adoption of AI within fashion. AI is a branch of computer science that combines machine learning, logic and natural language processing to emulate human intelligence. By processing vast amounts of data and recognising patterns in the data, AI produces insights and analytics at or above human capability (IEEE 2017). It has been applied to fashion in trend forecasting, personalisation, customer interaction and the use of CGI models. For example, Amazon developed “Echo Look” which combines computer vision with predictive AI and human analysis to assess a consumer’s current wardrobe choices and provide recommendations of what to wear. Users can ask the machine to rate two different possible outfits in terms of current trends and actual appearance (Gibbs 2017). Online styling subscription Stitch Fix uses machine learning algorithms to determine its customers’ preferred styles and offer personalised recommendations. AI has also been developed to mimic the role of social media influencers and models. CGI character “Miquela” has 1.6 million Instagram followers, collaborates with luxury brands and launched her own clothing brand, but is not a real person. There is a dedicated digital modelling agency (Davis 2018). Such innovations are likely to further inflame the ongoing ethical debate about using digital technologies and virtual reality at the risk of opportunities for real people, for example diminishing already scarce opportunities for black models (Graham 2018), or introducing norms of artificial appearance and personal aesthetics impossible for ‘real’ people to achieve. AI has the potential to revolutionise fashion through greater precision, accuracy and effectiveness in decision-making, but at what cost? To what extent can and should AI replicate and replace human creativity and presence in an industry sector founded on human input in creating new trends? Yet, AI that predicts garment suitability and offers greater customisation for consumers may reduce waste and over-consumption (Snow 2017). Producing items which have greater relevance could reduce returns, markdowns and warehouse space, plus increase customer satisfaction and experience. Automating repetitive tasks could save money and time for greater value-added activities, for example through the use of chatbots for online customer service. This paper applies the lens of CSR to inform the debate on whether core fashion retailing functions can and should be replaced by AI. A CSR approach argues for businesses assuming social responsibilities beyond any economic, technical and legal obligations which constitute its existence, with the objective of reconciling economic, social and environmental objectives (Davis 1973)..

Sentiment is fundamental to human communication. Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called SiEBERT) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon.. Deep Contextual Language Models Machine Learning Meta-Analysis Natural Language Processing Sentiment Analysis Text Mining Transfer Learning&#x27;, &#x27;Complementing human effort in online reviews: A deep learning approach to automatic content generation and review synthesis. Online product reviews are ubiquitous and helpful sources of information available to consumers for making purchase decisions. Consumers rely on both the quantitative aspects of reviews such as valence and volume as well as textual descriptions to learn about product quality and fit. In this paper we show how new achievements in natural language processing can provide an important assist for different kinds of review-related writing tasks. Working in the interesting context of wine reviews, we demonstrate that machines are capable of performing the critical marketing task of writing expert reviews directly from a fairly small amount of product attribute data (metadata). We conduct a kind of “Turing Test” to evaluate human response to our machine-written reviews and show strong support for the assertion that machines can write reviews that are indistinguishable from those written by experts. Rather than replacing the human review writer, we envision a workflow wherein machines take the metadata as inputs and generate a human readable review as a first draft of the review and thereby assist an expert reviewer in writing their review. We next modify and apply our machine-writing technology to show how machines can be used to write a synthesis of a set of product reviews. For this last application we work in the context of beer reviews (for which there is a large set of available reviews for each of a large number of products) and produce machine-written review syntheses that do a good job – measured again through human evaluation – of capturing the ideas expressed in the reviews of any given beer. For each of these applications, we adapt the Transformer neural net architecture. The work herein is broadly applicable in marketing, particularly in the context of online reviews. We close with suggestions for additional applications of our model and approach as well as other directions for future research..

Today, climate change due to global warming is a significant concern to all of us. India&#x27;s rate of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing day by day, placing India in the top ten emitters in the world. Air pollution is one of the significant contributors to the greenhouse effect. Transportation contributes about 10% of the air pollution in India. The Indian government is taking steps to reduce air pollution by encouraging the use of electric vehicles. But, success depends on consumer&#x27;s sentiment, perception and understanding towards Electric Vehicles (EV). This case study tried to capture the feeling, attitude, and emotions of Indian consumers&#x27; towards electric vehicles. The main objective of this study was to extract opinions valuable to prospective buyers (to know what is best for them), marketers (for determining what features should be advertised) and manufacturers (for deciding what features should be improved) using Deep Learning techniques (e.g Doc2Vec Algorithm, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). Due to the very nature of social media data, big data platform was chosen to analyze the sentiment towards EV. Deep Learning based techniques were preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic regression and Decision tree, etc.) due to its superior text mining capabilities. Two years data (2016 to 2018) were collected from different social media platform for this case study. The results showed the efficiency of deep learning algorithms and found CNN yield better results in-compare to others. The proposed optimal model will help consumers, designers and manufacturers in their decision-making capabilities to choose, design and manufacture EV..

A Case Study of the Jodipan Colorful Urban Village, Malang, Indonesia. This study evaluated the branding of a slum project as a social marketing initiative to transform the Jodipan slum area into a tourism village in the city of Malang. An action–evaluation research project was conducted through the combination of the marketing and planning oriented approaches by the communications department at a major public university in Indonesia between June 2016 and October 2017. The study employed a case study supported by qualitative data from primary and secondary sources, including social media text mining analysis. Moreover, an evaluation survey was conducted using proportionally random sampling from 650 slum dwellers to assess the impacts of the project in terms of the general welfare of the community. The transformation of the slum area into a new tourist destination was found to have been successfully implemented through the combined marketing and planning-oriented community social marketing project. The tourist destination produced was also observed to have a good impact on environmental sustainability and economic value for the local community. Jodipan branding project is unique as observed in its ability to transform an unhealthy settlement into a healthy settlement. Theoretically, it has contributed to new knowledge on slum upgrading in urban studies, especially with the focus on the successful improvement of the physical, social, and economic conditions of the area. This research further contributed to a new understanding and novelty of knowledge on the ability of place branding, as a social marketing strategy, to change the behavior of slum dwellers. However, this research has limitations in exploring the local government’s response to the project, therefore, future studies need to clarify issues relating to local policies and official budgets for its sustainability..

Purpose: Travel websites allow tourists to share their thoughts, beliefs and experiences regarding various travel destinations. In this paper, the researchers demonstrated an approach for destination marketing organisations to explore online tourist-generated content and understand tourists&#x27; perceptions of the destination image (DI). Specifically, the researchers initiated an investigation examining how the destination image of Macau changed during the period of 2014–2018 based on user-generated content on travel websites. Design/methodology/approach: Web crawlers developed by Python were employed to collect tourists&#x27; reviews from both Ctrip and TripAdvisor regarding the theme of “Macau attraction”. A total of 51,191 reviews (41,352 from Ctrip and 9,839 from TripAdvisor) were collected and analysed using the text-mining technique. Findings: The results reveal that the frequency of casino-related words decreased in reviews by both international and mainland Chinese tourists. Additionally, international and mainland Chinese tourists perceive the DI of Macau differently. Mainland Chinese tourists are more sensitive to new attractions, while international tourists are not. The study also shows that there are differences between the government-projected DI and the tourist-perceived DI. Only the “City of Culture” and “A World Centre of Tourism and Leisure” have built recognition with tourists. Originality/value: Given the easy accessibility of online information from various sources, it is important for destination marketing organisations to analyse and monitor different DI perspectives and adjust their branding strategies for greater effectiveness. This study uncovered the online DI of Macau by using text mining and content analysis of two of the largest travel websites. By analysing and comparing the differences and relationships among the frequently used words of tourist-generated content on these websites, the researchers revealed some interesting findings with important marketing implications..

Purpose: This study initiated an investigation of how the Macau–Zhuhai tourism cooperated and discussed how Macau and Zhuhai could join hands to develop tourism in the region. The study demonstrated an approach for destination marketing organizations to explore online tourist-generated content and to understand tourists&#x27; perceptions of the destination image (DI). Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,291,057 reviews (535,317 for Macau and 755,740 for Zhuhai) were collected, analyzed and examined to determine how the DI s of Macau and Zhuhai changed during the period of 2015–2019 based on tourist-generated content on travel websites (TripAdvisor, Ctrip.com and Qyer.com) through a text-mining approach. Findings: The result revealed that Macau and Zhuhai were in a hybrid of competition and collaboration on tourism DI s. First, Macau and Zhuhai competed in hotel and catering industry. Macau was appealing to international tourists and provided high-end and prestigious offerings; while Zhuhai was impressed by cost-effective accommodation and food. Second, Macau diversified industrial structure with diverse “Tourism, Leisure and Recreation” and “Culture, History and Art” more than Zhuhai did. Meanwhile, Macau should balance the different demands of international and Chinese tourists. Third, complementary potentials were found in natural resources, urbanization technology and tourism innovation and related projects. Practical implications: The research provides valuable insights for policymakers and industrial managers on their endeavors to develop DIs. Policymakers should be able to develop supportive mechanisms and tourism facilitators to promote industrial collaboration and mutual DIs. Managers could refer to the components in the changing DIs and identify the developmental gaps and cooperation potentials in their targeted areas. Originality/value: The research fulfills the gap in regional tourism studies on Macau, in which the evaluation on synergetic influence and neighbor effect from Zhuhai has been underexplored. Facilitated by up-to-date data mining techniques, the study contributes to both DI and coopetition literature in tourism marketing; and this should inspire further studies on the antecedences of DI changes, resolutions to the competing interests and DIs of different stakeholders in different forms of strategic cooperation in regional tourism. The employment of DIs is an explicit demonstration of tourists&#x27; immersion and values attached to the destination, providing effective cues on the status of coopetition..

Purpose: As the retail banking institutions are becoming more customer centric, their focus on service quality is increasing. Established service quality frameworks such as SERVQUAL and SERVPERF have been applied in the banking sector. While these models are widely accepted, they are expensive because of the need for replication across bank branches. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel, user friendly and cost effective approach by amalgamating the traditional concept of service quality in banks (marketing base) and sentiment analysis literature (information systems base). Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the main objective is to analyze user reviews to better understand the correlation between RATER dimension sentiment scores as independent variables and user overall rating (customer satisfaction) grouping in “good” and “bad” as dependent variable through development of authors’ own logistic regression model using lexicon-based sentiment analysis. The model has been developed for three largest private banks in India pertaining to three banking product categories of loans, savings and current accounts and credit cards. Findings: The results show that the responsiveness and tangibles dimensions significantly impact the user evaluation rating. Even though the three largest private banks in India are concentrating on the tangibles dimension, not all of them are sufficiently focused on the responsiveness dimension. Additionally, customers looking for loan products are more susceptible to negative perceptions on service quality. Originality/value: This study has highlighted two types of scores whereby user provided overall evaluation scores help provide validation to the sentiment scores. The developed model can be used to assess performance of a bank in comparison to its peers and to generate in depth insights on point of parity (POP) and point of difference (POD) fronts.. Customer satisfaction Service marketing Service quality&#x27;, &#x27;Exploring mobile banking adoption and service quality features through user-generated content: the application of a topic modeling\xa0approach to Google Play\xa0Store reviews. Purpose: The primary purpose of this research is to analyze the online user reviews, where real customer experiences can be observed, with text mining and machine learning approaches, which are seen as a gap in the related literature. This study aims to compare the latent themes uncovered by the topic modeling approach with studies focused on both mobile banking (m-banking) adaptation and service quality features, suggest new aspects and examine the effect of latent topics on customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed 21,526 reviews posted by customers of private and state banks operating in Türkiye. An unsupervised machine learning method, Latent Dirichlet\xa0algorithm (LDA), was conducted to reveal topics, and the distribution of all reviews was visualized with the t-SNE algorithm. Random Forest, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms were utilized to predict user satisfaction through the given score. Findings: In total, 11 topics were revealed by considering user reviews based on their experience. Among these topics, perceived usefulness and convenience and time-saving are much more important in the scoring given to m-banking apps. Furthermore, in more detail, seven topics have been identified related to technical and security problems related to m-banking apps. Originality/value: This paper is a pioneer study regarding the method used and sample size reached in the m-banking literature. The findings also provide fresh insight into the post-Covid-19 era, both academically and practically, by providing new features for mobile bank adoption..

Purpose: In Indonesia, subjective issues towards the fundamental of Islamic banks (IBs) have been arising. For example, they are claimed to be not in line with the Shari‘ah (Islamic law). Furthermore, the existing scholarly works have not much gained knowledge from the local IBs explaining their efforts in promoting maqasid al-Shariah (objectives of Islamic law). Hence, because religiosity drives the fundamental establishment of IBs, this paper aims to explore the knowledge of how IBs in Indonesia promote maqasid al-Shariah via their published reports. Design/methodology/approach: This paper performs text mining from 24 official reports of 5 IBs in Indonesia published from 2015 to 2017. The sample contains 7,162 digital pages and approximately 3,021,618 words. Traditional text mining via human intelligence is first performed to analyse for the numerical data required in the maqasid al-Shariah index (MSI) analysis. Furthermore, a computer-driven text mining using the ‘Text Search’ feature of NVivo 12 Plus is conducted to perform qualitative analysis. These approaches are made to gain relevant knowledge of how the sampled IBs promote maqasid al-Shariah from their published reports. Findings: The analysis using the MSI explains a quantified maqasid al-Shariah on the sample’s performance, which indictes the lowest and the highest performing banks. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis supports the evidence from the quantitative analysis. It explains the authors’ coding process that results in 2 parent nodes and 20 child nodes, which contain 435 references coded from the sampled unstructured and bilingual texts. These nodes explain the information that associates with maqasid al-Shariah from the IBs’ reports. These findings explain how maqasid al-Shariah is measured mathematically and represent relevant knowledge of how maqasid al-Shariah is informed practically via digital texts. Research limitations/implications: A positivist generalisation is neither intended nor established in this study. Practical implications: This paper gains relevant knowledge of how the sampled IBs in Indonesia control and maintain the implementation of maqasid al-Shariah from large textual data. Such knowledge is practically important for IBs stakeholders in Indonesia; moreover to help navigate the Shari‘ah identity of Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI), the new IB established from the merger of 3 state-owned IBs, which are among the sample of this study. Social implications: This paper provides evidence that might best challenge the subjective issue of IBs claiming that they are not in line with the Shari‘ah, particularly in Indonesia. Originality/value: This paper is among the pioneers that discover knowledge of how IBs promote maqasid al-Shariah in Indonesia’s banking sector via a text mining approach..

Research on voluntary disclosure highlights the role of informative financial reporting for capital markets. Information asymmetry impedes the efficient allocation of resources in capital markets while credible disclosure between managers and investors plays an important role in mitigating these problems. Existing research provides limited insight into firms’ disclosure of information about their market-based assets such as brands, although brand is an important part of firms’ value proposition. This study aims to fill this research gap by investigating brand-related information (BRI) disclosure in US firms’ annual reports with three research steps. First, we develop the conceptualization of BRI, based on which, we build a BRI coding dictionary. We then conduct text mining on 10-K reports and construct a BRI disclosure index to capture the BRI disclosure level in firms’ 10-K reports. In the third step, we intend to explore the key factors driving BRI disclosure as well as its financial market consequences. We propose to empirically investigate how different levels of BRI disclosure are explained by firm characteristics and actual brand performance. We will also examine how BRI disclosure influences firm value, as well as the role that BRI disclosure plays in explaining the relationship between brand performance and firm value. This study fills the research gap in the field of information disclosure concerning BRI by conceptualizing a BRI framework and providing evidence on whether firms disclose BRI in financial reporting. This study will also contribute to marketing-finance literature by empirically investigating the informational value of BRI disclosure to firm value. The findings will provide managers and financial market participants (e.g., analysts, investors) who need to communicate and evaluate the performance implications of branding strategies and related activities with enlightenment on the value relevance of BRI disclosures.. Brand value Brand-related information Firm value Information disclosure Text mining&#x27;, &#x27;Understanding the role of entrepreneurial orientation in creating ambidextrous competitive advantage: a comparative-design, longitudinal study. Purpose: This research aims to investigate how entrepreneurial orientation influences a firm’s differentiation–cost advantage ambidexterity (DCAA) and performance indirectly through dynamic capabilities, while also investigating the impact of the interactive effect of the level and consistency of entrepreneurial orientation on dynamic capabilities. The goal of this study is to better understand the importance of consistently following an entrepreneurial orientation, as well as the linkage of such a consistently implemented strategy upon gaining both a cost and differentiation positioning enhancement. Design/methodology/approach: Two empirical studies are conducted to test the proposed hypotheses – one longitudinal with multiple forms of data (i.e. text data, survey data and archival data) from 100 Taiwanese electronics firms and the other using primary data from a survey of senior managers. Findings: Entrepreneurial orientation improves dynamic capabilities, which in turn promote superior DCAA and enhanced firm performance. In addition, as captured through a unique measure of consistency allowed through computer-aided text analysis, the results indicate that the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on dynamic capabilities is amplified when a firm consistently adopts entrepreneurial decisions and actions. Research limitations/implications: The specific context was a sample of electronics firms in Taiwan. This limits the generalization of findings, as would be possible with assessing the hypotheses in other industries. Practical implications: This research clearly demonstrates the significance of consistency in pursuing a strategic orientation. The consistent support and deployment of resources facilitates an organization’s achieving positive outcomes associated with an entrepreneurial orientation. Originality/value: While entrepreneurial orientation contributes to firm performance, extant knowledge on the internal process through which entrepreneurial orientation affects performance is relatively limited. The findings not only highlight the full mediating role of dynamic capabilities and DCAA, but also shed light on the importance of consistency in entrepreneurial orientation over time.. Ambidextrous competitive advantage Computer-aided text analysis Dynamic capabilities Entrepreneurial orientation Longitudinal design&#x27;, &#x27;Financial constraints and marketing investment: evidence from text analysis. Purpose: The purpose of this study to examine the effect of financial constraint on intangible investment because intangible investment provides an overall picture of marketing investment and activity. Intangible investment also plays a significant role in facilitating future sales. Using a new measure of intangible investment (Peters and Taylor, 2017), the authors first establish that intangible investment is positively related with future sales. Then, using a new text-based measure of financial constraint, the authors show that financial constraint has a significant negative effect on future intangible investments after controlling for other factors. Intangible investment has three components. The first is R&amp;D, the second is 30 per cent of selling and general administrative expense (SGA) and the third is other intangibles. The authors find that the negative and significant effect of financial constraint on 30 per cent SGA is stronger. This indicates that financially constrained firms reduce marketing related investments. The authors then considered firm size and found that smaller firms facing financial constraint continue to increase their intangible investments, whereas larger firms reduce their intangible investment. As a robustness test, the authors use advertising expenditure as a measure of promotion related investment and find that financial constraint has a negative effect on advertising spending. The authors then use two traditional measures of financial constraint in their analysis to compare with the new text-based measure. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use ordinary least squares with cluster robust standard error to conduct their empirical analysis. Findings: First the authors establish that intangible investment positively affects future sales. Further the authors find that financial constraint negatively affects intangible investment. Moreover, financial constraint negatively affects the brand capital of intangible investment. Research limitations/implications: The authors did not conduct any industry specific analysis to see how financial constraints affect intangible investment across different industries. Industry specific analysis is important because in some industries/sectors intangibles are clearly more important than in others, so this is an important avenue for future research. It will also be interesting to explore if and how financial constraint has a mediating effect on sales growth via intangible investment and different components of intangibles. Practical implications: This study identifies another important factor that can negatively affect brand capital investment. Originality/value: The authors have used a measure of financial constraint and text mined all the annual reports of US firms for the period of 1994-2016 to compute this measure..

Online firestorms pose severe threats to online brand communities. Any negative electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has the potential to become an online firestorm, yet not every post does, so finding ways to detect and respond to negative eWOM constitutes a critical managerial priority. The authors develop a comprehensive framework that integrates different drivers of negative eWOM and the response approaches that firms use to engage in and disengage from online conversations with complaining customers. A text-mining study of negative eWOM demonstrates distinct impacts of high-and low-arousal emotions, structural tie strength, and linguistic style match (between sender and brand community) on firestorm potential. The firm’s response must be tailored to the intensity of arousal in the negative eWOM to limit the virality of potential online firestorms. The impact of initiated firestorms can be mitigated by distinct firm responses over time, and the effectiveness of different disengagement approaches also varies with their timing. For managers, these insights provide guidance on how to detect and reduce the virality of online firestorms..

Purpose: This study analysed the effect of online negative word-of-mouth (nWOM) firestorms in the retail banking sector. By understanding negative sentiment and sentiment recovery across an entire retail banking sector, the research exposed a unique view of banking in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The study made use of both a sentiment and topic analysis of over 1.7 million social media posts in South Africa. The methodology made use of both NLP and human validation techniques to measure changes in social media sentiment during online firestorms. This measurement included each of South Africa&#x27;s major retail banks over a twelve month period. Findings: From the analysis, key trigger characteristics for these firestorms (product failures, service failures, social failures and communication failures) were categorised. In addition, the average duration of a firestorm was calculated and factors that impact sentiment recovery were explored. Originality/value: The study was located in South Africa and, unlike firm level studies, researched nWOM for the whole retail banking sector. A theoretical footprint depicting the typical anatomy of a firestorm was derived in order to aid stakeholders to be more vigilant and better equipped to provide correct intervention in such times of crisis.. Negative word-of-mouth (nWOM) Online firestorms Retail banks Sentiment analysis Social media&quot;, &#x27;Negative online reviews, brand equity and emotional contagion. Purpose: Despite the growing consensus that consumers extensively use online reviews and that negative reviews can significantly damage brand equity, it remains uncertain whether negative online reviews that focus on different aspects of a service have a similar or differential effect on brand equity. This study aims to fill this gap and explores the mediating role of emotional contagion and what kind of response helps better deter their negative effect. Design/methodology/approach: This research is conducted through a one-panel study and three experimental studies. SAS enterprise miner is used for text mining analysis and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Process macro models are used to analyze the experimental data. Findings: Negative reviews related to the tangibility, responsiveness and empathy dimensions have a more detrimental effect on brand equity than negative reviews related to the assurance and reliability dimensions. The results also provide evidence that emotional contagion is more prevalent when consumers read reviews that are specific to the empathy and responsiveness dimensions. Finally, accommodative responses from the service provider are more effective in deterring the effect of a negative online review on brand equity. Research limitations/implications: The generalizability of this study is limited to the restaurant and hotel industry. Practical implications: The findings will also help the brand manager in understanding the comparative effect of service quality-specific negative reviews on brand equity and also the type of responses that brand managers should give to negative reviews. Originality/value: Despite online reviews receiving increased attention in academic research, Service quality (SERVQUAL) dimension-specific reviews have not been studied until now. This study contributes to the service quality-related literature by providing evidence that not all negative online reviews related to different Service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions equally affect brand equity..

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the concepts and theories underlying customer service experience (CSE) and its underlying five dimensions (physical, social, cognitive, affective and sensorial). In this research, the contribution of the sensorial dimension to CSE research is emphasized. Senses are especially important in forming perceptions within servicescapes that are typically rich in sensory stimuli. Design/methodology/approach: This study systematically identifies 258 articles published between 1994 and 2018 in services and marketing journals. The analysis uses a text mining approach with the Leximancer software to extract research concepts and their relationships. Findings: The results demonstrate a shift from CSE research focused on brands and products toward value and interaction, around three focal areas: service system architecture, with its value creation processes; servicescape, with an increasingly digital interaction interface and outcome measures, with a stronger focus on emotional and relational metrics. In CSE research, the physical, social and cognitive dimensions are mostly researched in the focal areas of servicescape and outcome measures. Although important in practice, the sensorial dimension is the least investigated CSE dimension in service marketing research. Text mining insights demonstrate rich opportunities for sensorial research, particularly in studies on servicescape. Practical implications: The synthesis will inform managers and service providers which elements of CSE are most relevant to customers when forming perceptions. These insights help service providers to control, manage and design (multi)-sensory stimuli that influence how customers will make sense of the servicescape. Originality/value: This research is one of the first studies to examine the conceptual structure of CSE with a text mining approach that systematically analyzes a large set of articles, therein reducing the potential for researchers’ interpretative bias. The paper provides an assessment of the role of the largely neglected but crucial sensorial dimension, and offers future research suggestions into this emerging topic..

Purpose: Transformative service research (TSR) and social marketing share a common goal, which is to institute social change that improves individual and societal well-being. However, the mechanism via which such improved well-being results or so-called “transformation” occurs, is not well understood. The purpose of this paper is to examine the claims made in the TSR literature to identity the themes and scholarly meaning of “transformative” service exchange; ascertain the mechanisms used in service contexts to realize transformation, including to motivate long-term, sustainable societal change; and develop a transformative service exchange continuum to guide research and managerial approaches that aim to create uplifting social change. The authors recommend their continuum as a framework to inform how social marketing and service scholars design service solutions to address wicked social problems. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a qualitative study where Leximancer, a text-mining tool, is used to visualize the structure of themes and concepts that define transformative service exchanges as explained and applied in the literature. Additionally, a profiling analysis of transformation as it is discussed in the TSR literature is used to identify the mechanisms that service marketers have developed to establish current theorization of service thinking for social change. These qualitative phases of analysis then inform the development of the transformative service exchange continuum. Findings: A scoping review identified 51 articles across 12 journals, based on this study’s selection criteria for identifying transformative service exchanges. The Leximancer analysis systematically and efficiently guided the authors’ interpretation of the large data corpus and was used in the identification of service themes. The use of text-mining software afforded a detailed lens to enrich the authors’ interpretation and clarification of six high-level concepts for inclusion on a transformative service exchange continuum. Originality/value: This paper aims to unpack the meaning of transformative service exchange by highlighting the mechanism(s) used by researchers when designing social change outcomes. It contributes to TSR via the development of the continuum across micro, meso and macro levels. The temporal nature of transformative service exchanges is also elucidated. This continuum integrates current TSR studies and can guide future service studies in the TSR and social marketing domains.. Qualitative research Service ecosystem Social marketing Transformative&#x27;, &#x27;Exploring the Holistic Customer Experience Gestalt through its Elements: An Abstract. Customer experience (CE) is the essence of what constitutes the interaction of a service and a customer. It is multidimensional and comprised of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, sensorial, and social elements resulting from a direct or indirect interaction with a firm (Lemon and Verhoef 2016, p. 71). CE has many definitions and descriptions of its constituent elements, which adds a layer of complexity in constructing comparable studies across the board. This fragmentation poses limitations for new researchers who attempt to study CE, described as “widely used, and abused”, and at the risk of being “dismissed because of the ambiguous manner in which it has been applied” (Palmer 2010, p. 196). To this extent, the aim of this work is to (i) explore the definitions of CE and its elements, (ii) analyze conceptual and empirical studies relating to these elements, and (iii) from the previous two objectives incorporate a bottom-up approach, producing a unified elemental mapping framework enabling a more integrated and holistic manner in which CE is studied and observed in both academia and practice. Following the objectives for this work, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) search pertaining to CE and its elements, analyzing the different conceptualizations of its meaning and empirical foundations. We then extract and semantically group the CE elements into a unified list. After reviewing and analyzing our results we note that the literature defines CE through socioeconomic, phenomenological, or a combination of these lenses. Furthermore, we observe that these lenses are driven along service and customer centric perspectives. We build upon the inductive experiential mapping scheme used by Lofman (1991) to build a sub-elemental framework from the unified CE element list we obtained. From a theoretical standpoint, we attempt to redefine CE from the extant SLR. Additionally, we propose a sub-elemental mapping framework which would alleviate some of the conceptual fragmentation we highlighted in studying CE. From a managerial standpoint, we aim at addressing CE managers and executives by providing them with a theoretically-driven framework enabling them to map their organizational CE. As a result, a standardized means to measure and better understand CE in practice could be achieved. As a way forward, our mapping framework could provide a starting point to potentially connect technology-driven methods using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to for example, utilize text-mining, and heuristic internet of things to map experiential data. This would enable researchers and managers to conduct studies in different contexts and domains, providing a customer-centric approach to CE while subsequently contributing to our holistic understanding of this concept..
