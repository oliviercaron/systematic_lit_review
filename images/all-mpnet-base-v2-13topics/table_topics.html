Ever-increasing numbers of customers are taking to online platforms to review their experiences offering social proof to other potential customers (Kaemingk, 2020), thereby reducing uncertainty for others (Mladenovic et al., 2019). These reviews influence the purchase decisions of others (Kaemingk, 2020; Perkins &amp; Fenech, 2014), while also providing a valuable source of information for firms (Balducci &amp; Marinova, 2018). A growing body of literature is seeking to analyze and develop quantitative insights from this readily available unstructured data (e.g., Ferreira et al., 2022; Korfiatis et al., 2018; Lord Ferguson et al., 2020; Pitt et al., 2018; Robertson et al., 2021). Researchers and practitioners alike have acknowledged the importance of the correct analysis and interpretation of this data as a vital input in firm decision-making (Boon et al., 2013). The majority of academic research has focused on the impact of online reviews on customer decision-making, with much less literature assessing the methodologies used to analyze and interpret online reviews as a source of customer intelligence for the firm (Palese &amp; Piccoli, 2016). To this end, this methodological paper examines how service firms can analyze unstructured data by using a computerized text analysis to assess evaluations of their customers’ experiences. The proposed methodological approach recommends the use of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) as the computerized text analysis tool, offering a practical application of the tool in the healthcare insurance industry. The LIWC analysis establishes four summary variables designed to identify psychological states, thinking styles, emotional tone, and social concerns (Pennebaker et al., 2015). These lexical components can be used in a regression analysis to predict evaluations of customers’ experience. The findings of the practical application suggest that the lexical analysis of online customer reviews is able to predict evaluations of their customers’ experiences. The results offer service firms an inexpensive methodology with which to assess real-time, readily available evaluations of customer experiences. In addition, this research is among the first of its kind to make use of a computerized text analysis of customer-generated content as a tool to predict their evaluations of a service experience. The research indicates that firms in the service industry can use unstructured data in the form of online customer reviews and transform it into a numerical format to assess customers’ experiences. This methodology greatly impacts the availability of real time data and cost effectiveness of service quality research..

Neuromarketing can be defined as both an innovative research methodology that makes use of neuroscience techniques and as field of study that merges marketing principles and neuroscience theory. As a research methodology, neuromarketing has the potential to detect unconscious processes and activities that are difficult to access through traditional advertising research methods. As a field of study, neuromarketing refers to a link between neuroscience theory (and methods) and marketing techniques. The emergence of neuromarketing as a new field of study has created ethical concerns about the use and misuse of neuroscience technologies, under the premise of advancing the understanding of consumer behavior. The ethical issues concerning neuromarketing research suggest that consumers need more information about neuromarketing in order to understand its implications and to protect themselves from the negligent research behaviors of companies. Thus, taking into consideration the relevant role of consumers in neuromarketing as both participants of the experiments and final recipients of the “benefits” derived from firms’ marketing decisions, an understanding of what consumers think about neuromarketing becomes critical. To examine consumer opinions, a content analysis of neuromarketing blogs and social media sites was selected as the exploratory method to uncover the “voice” of consumers about neuromarketing. Three text-analytics techniques were used to examine the texts, namely, word frequency analysis, story network analysis, and sentiment analysis. The implications of this content analysis of neuromarketing texts from blogs and social media are twofold. First, the three-step methodology used for the analysis of texts represents a helpful tool for marketers and demonstrates the importance of user-generated content (UGC) as a valuable source of consumer information. Conventional wisdom suggests that listening to what customers say and where they are saying it, can help a firm make decisions regarding their brands, products, and services. Marketers must recognize that more effort has to be allocated to social media observation and the analysis of the data provided through these sites. Second, the findings of this research represent the “voice” of consumers regarding the emerging field of neuromarketing. This exploratory study can help neuromarketing research firms, scientists, academics, and marketers understand consumer perceptions, feelings, and attitudes toward neuromarketing. Specifically, this research makes evident that consumer sentiment of neuromarketing is mostly positive; however, some concerns regarding the ethical use of the method still need to be addressed. Therefore, it is critical that government, companies, neuromarketing firms, researchers, and consumer advocacy organizations work together in the creation of regulations, standards, and a code of ethics for neuromarketing.. NA&#x27;, &#x27;Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Marketing Scientific Literature: An Abstract. We discuss the development of a machine-based research literature reading methodology for marketing science based on artificial intelligence (AI) developments made in other fields. Marketing science would benefit from adopting AI-based technologies for text mining, analysis and predictive writing. This could automate literature review and formulation of hypotheses. Scientific progress is disseminated in scientific publications, which are growing exponentially. Thousands of papers are published each year. Research overload is a bottleneck for scientific development. Keeping up is untenable for researchers even within specialised fields. Recognising new questions or hypotheses will be increasingly challenging. The rapid increase in the rate of research points out the need for techniques that can simplify its use. AI techniques such as text mining and natural language processing (NLP) can assist in removing the bottleneck. Text mining is the use of algorithms for extracting information from text documents such as scientific articles. In AI, NLP is used to analyse large amounts of natural language data. The combination of NLP and text mining techniques enables scientific literature text mining with NLP. In this regard, the most advanced developments have been made in the disciplines of chemistry and materials (e.g. Kim et al. 2017; Tshitoyan et al. 2019). In these fields, knowledge extraction and relationships are made using massive bodies of scientific literature using CrossRef Application Programming Interface (API) to retrieve large lists of article Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). Our suggested method for marketing science will be based on the developments made in chemicals and materials. Word embeddings will be trained with marketing science abstracts retrieved from scientific databases (e.g. Elsevier and Science Direct). After removing irrelevant abstracts, the remaining relevant ones will be tokenised. This will result in a vocabulary formed by the extracted contents. We shall then conduct a three-step process adopted from Tshitoyan et al. (2019). First, the compilation of consolidated bodies of offline marketing science research such as retail or advertising. Second, the embeddings will be trained with scientific abstracts from each topic. The abstracts will then be tokenised to produce individual words. Third, we shall repeat the first two integrating the offline topics with the equivalent online topics (i.e. online retail or advertising). Lessons learned when dealing with the offline research may help inform analyses made with the online research. Our method could eventually facilitate transfer of research knowledge to marketing practice, especially to startups, due to the increasing need for applying research to practice (Kumar 2017; Lilien 2011)..

Purpose: The primary purpose of this research is to analyze the online user reviews, where real customer experiences can be observed, with text mining and machine learning approaches, which are seen as a gap in the related literature. This study aims to compare the latent themes uncovered by the topic modeling approach with studies focused on both mobile banking (m-banking) adaptation and service quality features, suggest new aspects and examine the effect of latent topics on customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed 21,526 reviews posted by customers of private and state banks operating in Türkiye. An unsupervised machine learning method, Latent Dirichlet\xa0algorithm (LDA), was conducted to reveal topics, and the distribution of all reviews was visualized with the t-SNE algorithm. Random Forest, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms were utilized to predict user satisfaction through the given score. Findings: In total, 11 topics were revealed by considering user reviews based on their experience. Among these topics, perceived usefulness and convenience and time-saving are much more important in the scoring given to m-banking apps. Furthermore, in more detail, seven topics have been identified related to technical and security problems related to m-banking apps. Originality/value: This paper is a pioneer study regarding the method used and sample size reached in the m-banking literature. The findings also provide fresh insight into the post-Covid-19 era, both academically and practically, by providing new features for mobile bank adoption..

Experiences are a critical element in creating value for customers of service companies. In the tourism industry, employee–tourist encounters are particularly important as a lever for experience value creation. However, typically such encounters are based on a service quality logic that is standardised and functional (based on standard quality theory), thus missing considerable opportunities for employee-related experience creation. In this research, we seek to apply big data analytics to identify the types of customer–employee interactions that are the most influential in improving customers’ perceptions of service, value and overall satisfaction. A popular and well-known review website was selected to provide data for a range of hotel rankings (one- to five-stars) and sentiment performance. English language reviews and related variables associated with each review were used. This provided more than a quarter of a million reviews for analysis. A dictionary of terms was created by collecting and compiling synonyms associated with the types of hotel customer–employee interaction based on personalisation, flexibility, co-creation, emotions and knowledge gain/learning. Dictionary terms were also developed for mentions of employees. The process helped us to develop a final list of 639 words. To improve the computational efficiency of the analysis, the data were pre-processed using Python’s Natural Language Toolkit. In order to focus on the most objective and reliable reviews, we reduced the sample to those reviews with a subjectivity level less than or equal to 0.5. Each review was then content-analysed for sentiment and interaction type in order to explore these important relationships statistically. ANOVA tests were applied to examine differences in service quality, satisfaction and value based. The overall assessment of our results appears to suggest that hotel customers are difficult to please; positive employee–customer interactions receive significant positive improvements in customer perceptions of satisfaction, values and service, but customers are extremely sensitive to any problems in employee–customer interactions. Amongst the types of employee interactions, emotional intelligence and co-creation of customer experiences appeared to be the most promising for increasing the three outcome variables, whilst flexibility appeared to be a critical element of employee interactions not to get wrong. The research has significant implications for future research and practice.. Consumer experience Employee interactions Text analytics Tourism&#x27;, &#x27;Do they Expect Differently in Hotel Experiences? Views of Eastern vs. Western: An Abstract. This study sheds light on ways online guests’ rating in the hotel review website TripAdvisor differ between Chinese- and English-speaking groups. The study adopted mixed methodology and applied with both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The dual analysis with 800 online reviews of eight hotel brands that considered as a representative of its category located in Bangkok city, Thailand. Results from quantitative analysis revealed that 2-star hotels were rated positively than 3- to 5-star hotels. English-speaking guests gave higher ratings than Chinese-speaking guest in all the hotel service attributes (e.g. Service, Cleanliness, Room, Sleep Quality, Location, Value, and Overall). From qualitative aspect, ten service attributes that impacted on traveler satisfaction were identified. These attributes were then classified into three broad themed categories known as Intangible Service, Tangible Service and Staying Experience. The result further reveals the most frequently used words when cross-cultural travelers give online reviews on the sites. Implications of the divergences in themes abstracted are discussed. The current research offers practical insights for hotel operators who would like to improve their service quality. More online reviews on the hotels’ webs is better for the hotel performance since those online reviews can be considered as good references for the travelers during their searching process. Positive reviews mean satisfaction and positively influence on consumer purchase decision while negative reviews consider as a gift for hoteliers for further development their service standard. In this case, the hotelier could consider developing the customer incentive system (e.g. membership rewards) to guests who post reviews of hotels products and services on the social media platforms, which plays an important role in eWOM for younger generation who prefers using social media platform rather than traditional WOM (Kim et al. 2016)..

Under the shadow of the covid-19 pandemic, millions of young people have the resulting consequences (e.g., increased uncertainty regarding their careers and economic prospects: McGrindle, 2020; Yuesti et al., 2020) started to think more seriously about how to manage their financial resources. As a result, personal finance has become trendy to speak about. Rather than proactive actions coming through the formal financial services industry to address the increasing demand for accessible financial information that does not require an advisor or costs a fortune, we are witnessing the uprising of personal finance influencers. These financial influencers (a.k.a. Finfluencers) talk about how to manage various aspects of financial life and do so by promoting their advice on a broad scope of money related topics (ranging from dealing with student loans, buying a house, how to ask for a pay raise, budgeting tips, and tricks, filing for tax returns, stock investment opportunities, and portfolio management) in short, light-hearted video formats that are posted on Instagram, Tiktok, YouTube and other social media platforms. Although currently, these Finfluencers can be regarded as a niche influencer marketing group, it is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years – especially now that designated sections on social media platforms are taking off (e.g., #FinTok, #FinTwit, #Finmeme, #StockTok, #Findependence). In line with this trend, this research explores how consumers consume social media influencers when they offer utilitarian (rather than hedonic) oriented products, services, and advice. Using text-mining techniques, we examine the content of personal finance influencers on Instagram to investigate how consumers respond to the recommendation of more utilitarian-oriented products. In addition, gender and race are an integral part of the consumer’s perception of financial expertise. This research looks at the moderating role of gender and race on influencers’ financial expertise on consumer response. We found that influencers with financial accreditations generate a more positive affective response compared with financial influencers who mainly share information stemming from personal experience. In addition, we found that influencers’ gender and race moderate the relationship between financial expertise and consumers’ affective responses significantly..

In disasters there is a need to rapidly assess and predict impact area boundaries (for staging emergency relief and product distribution dynamics), delineate and communicate with the affected public (for coordinated disaster assistance such as evacuation, search and rescue, prioritization of manpower and equipment usage, etc.), and provide cost estimation for potential use in government-to-government (G2G) marketing (Golden and Peterson 2018) soliciting relief and assistance funds from federal and/or state authorities. This rapid assessment needs to occur as the disaster unfolds and immediately after the disaster, even while data is scarce and emerging. Marketing communication techniques and modern information technology methods (machine learning, geospatial information, and social media text mining) can help with these tasks. This paper shows how to use predictive modeling and geospatial interpolation along with machine learning for pre-disaster community planning, for risk management actions during the disaster, and for assisting in creating informed structure regulations to assist in disaster resilience. As disaster response is an ongoing process, the technique provides a framework of spatial level loss estimation using limited evolving data and iteratively improves estimation as more data becomes available. Predictive and probabilistic modeling starts with historical data (compiled before the event) including data such as damage to a specific building type as a function of water depth or wind speed. Topography of the land involved is assessed using satellite and LIDAR data and publically available flood maps created by FEMA for the National Flood Insurance Program and topographic maps produced in the US Topo project of the National Geospatial Program of the US Geological Survey (USGS). These baseline GIS datasets are overlaid with GIS-located data on building type and construction materials and usage scraped from county tax assessor websites. After buildings are GIS mapped, the FEMA’s HAZUS algorithm is used to estimate damages to each building as a function of projected area water depth. The water depth projection is determined by regression using wind speed and recurrence interval (i.e., Hurricane Harvey in Texas in 2017 was a 1 in 1,000 year event). As data becomes gradually available, we iteratively update estimates for areas using spatial interpolation. This informs communication modes of contact. To better assess impact area and population at risk with limited data, machine learning is applied. In disasters people often are active on mobile phones. GIS located text mining messages reveals who needs what and where, directs rescue, and improve damage estimates when data is sparse, and allow target messaging to vulnerable populations (Lazreg et al. 2016).

The amount of videos users watch on social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, has almost doubled since 2018 (Hayes, 2022). In marketing, videos are an increasingly successful means for brand to engage with consumers, with several studies finding that video content leads to more consumer engagement (i.e., liking, commenting, or sharing) than text content, which affects brand attitudes and purchase intentions (e.g., Li &amp; Xie, 2020). Social media influencers generate a significant amount of video content online, while many brands spend at least 10% of their yearly marketing budget on influencer marketing (Geyser, 2021). However, there is a gap in research investigating the key characteristics in influencer posts that lead to engagement, particularly when it comes to video rather than textual content. In short, there is a need for more understanding about how best to design video content that engages customers. With this in mind, we explore how video characteristics in influencer marketing campaigns affect consumer engagement (in the form of liking and commenting). Specifically, we ask: (1) how emotional facial expressions in video content, and (2) corresponding post descriptions (i.e., textual cues) affect consumer engagement with influencers’ social media posts. To answer our research questions, we collected 2,376 social media posts from Instagram that were published from 1,240 influencers in partnership with 145 brands across ten product categories, such as apparel, beauty, and technology. All videos were analysed using Schwenzow et al.’s (2020) video tool that enables researchers to analyse a broad range of video characteristics on a large scale. The post descriptions were analysed with Language Inquiry Word Count (LIWC-22). LIWC is a text-analytics software (Tausczik &amp; Pennebaker, 2010) that uses dictionaries to calculate the degree to which each piece of text contains specific category words, such as first-person pronouns or emotional words (e.g., happy, cried, nice, ugly). Our results show that, compared to neutral facial expressions, emotional facial expressions in the video are negatively associated with engagement. On the contrary, we find that emotionality in the post description is positively associated with engagement. Finally, our findings suggest a significant moderation effect of product category (hedonic vs. utilitarian) on the relationship between emotionality in the post description and engagement. Theoretically, drawing on an interplay of theories including emotional contagion theory and heuristic-systematic model of information processing, we shed light on the nature of the relationship between social media post characteristics and consumer engagement in an influencer context. Practically, we provide advice on how a popular form of marketing content, video, can be used in an increasingly popular marketing context; influencer marketing..

An Abstract. Online product reviews have become the single, largest depository of supplementary information that customers use in their product search, evaluation, and purchase process. The innate value of online reviews lays in the valuable information they provide to prospective customers in their decision making. This has inspired researchers to identify the characteristics of helpful reviews. Extent research suggests that helpful reviews are often of certain numeric features, such as lengthy details and unequivocal rating (Karimi and Wang 2017; Mudambi and Schuff 2010). However, these numeric features do not reveal the nature of the review content. Recognizing the importance of review content, recent studies gear toward examining review content, with a focus on sentiment, using text analysis techniques (Cao et al. 2011; Salehan and Kim 2016). Apart from sentiment, the impact of other content characteristics of online reviews is largely unknown. This research explores online review content by decomposing and comparing three fundamental information components that a review may contain: sensory information (i.e., reviewer’s observation), cognitive information (i.e., thoughts/analysis), and affective information (i.e., emotions). These components are directly associated with three fundamental psychological processes (observation, thinking, and emotion) that people experience to interact with and make sense of the world. When writing a review, reviewers tangle various types of information together to construct narratives and express opinions, creating a complex review content. Readers, on the other side, retrieve and evaluate the information of all types to form an opinion on the quality and helpfulness of the review. Distinguishing these different information components and analyzing their direct and combined effects can significantly enhance our knowledge of consumer’s information needs and online search behavior. This research performs text analysis to capture the three types of information in online product reviews, analyze their patterns and effects on perceived information value. Results from analyzing a sample of 56,752 reviews from Amazon.com indicate that sensory information in online review content has a significantly positive effect on online review helpfulness; whereas, this effect is insignificant for cognitive information, and significantly negative for affective information. This indicates that review readers highly value reviewer’s observations and their expression of sensory experience, are indifferent toward reviewer’s thoughts and analysis, and dislike expression of emotions in review content. This pattern is more salient in reviews of search goods than those of experience goods..

Experts’ reviews shape consumer’s preferences and purchase decisions because they are often perceived as unbiased and trustworthy. Wine industry is a high value agricultural industry from the perspectives of both the main raw agricultural and the value added in the finished products. As a high value industry to both governments and consumers, countries spend billions on marketing their agricultural industries to not only their own citizens but also foreign citizens all over the world including these experts to establish a good product reputation. This paper examines the role of country of origin in expert eWOM (ratings and reviews) through large dataset from the global wine industry. Furthermore, we processed the review content by applying a structured automated text analysis program Diction. The result of ANOVA test demonstrates that there are significant differences between countries in terms of price, rating, and all the Diction content dimensions at the p\xa0&amp;lt;\xa00.001. We also find significant effects on wine quality ratings of price, country of origin, and review of content by conducting regression analysis. Indicated by the size of effect on ratings, expert reviewers use price as signal of quality when they provide eWOM. Country image significantly influences their review in most cases exception of Australia and France. USA variable is non-significant when considered alone but is significant when considered with price. France variable is non-significant with price included in the regression but has a significant bonus in ratings when not considering the effect of price. The Australia variable was non-significant in all regression analysis indicating that there was Australian wine ratings were not statistically different than minor wine producing countries. This paper provides several contributions in the field of expert eWOM and country of origin literatures. Wine producer in prestigious wine producing countries such as Germany and Italy can extract a price premium related to the country that is perceived by expert as high quality. However, producers in less prestigious wine producing countries (e.g., South African or Chilean) can signal quality through a higher price that can help them overcome the country image bias and aid the perception by experts of high quality, and they can also take advantage of the low price segment of consumers. Producers can also manage expert eWOM by priming these reviewers to use more active, certain, optimistic language in reviews to increase quality ratings. Furthermore, governments and industry associations can encourage experts to writes reviews with active, optimistic and central language to have an influence on quality rating, and thus develop country images.. eWOM bias Expert reviews Intext-mining Wine&#x27;, &#x27;Differences in Online Review Content between Old and New Products: An Abstract. Online product reviews are one of the most important sources of information that influences the consumer decision making process. Studies have shown a positive relationship between online reviews and product sales. Not surprisingly, extant research has studied the factors that influence reviews such as include reviewer credibility and review content, review volume, valence, and dispersion, the impact of negative versus positive reviews, and the influence of product category. Despite the important influence of online reviews on consumer decision making, there are several key empirical and theoretical questions in the domain of online reviews that remain unanswered. Extensive research on online reviews has been taken place for movies, books, and television shows. There has been relatively limited research into reviews for new products in other, less well-known product categories. In addition, most research has focused on the volume, valence, and variance of reviews. Research investigating review content is emerging, although much of this research is based on standard attributes of the text using packages like LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count). Research investigating more specific aspects of review content is less prevalent. Finally, there have been several studies focused on the impact of online reviews on new products sales and review-based mining to get the pricing power of different attributes. However, these inquiries have not taken into consideration how reviews for new products differ from reviews for similar products that already exist and are available online. The aim of this paper is to compare content of online reviews for new and established products. We seek to understand how consumers evaluate old and new products in the same category based on online reviews and whether there are systematic differences in the type of content discussed for each type of product. We use Amazon review data from two categories to compare review content for a new product and the leading established product in each category. The present study serves as a pilot to examine the efficacy of machine-based coding of product reviews along a number of relevant dimensions and probe for potential differences to inform future research. We find that there is a difference in the way consumers review old and new products in a category. The reviews of new products are highly descriptive and detailed with experiences shared by the users. Additionally, when we look at the attribute-wise impact on the ratings, it is found that attributes that are common to both seem to have a higher impact on the ratings than attributes which stand out in the new products..

McDonald&#x27;s introduced a modified Chinese zodiac promotion to celebrate Chinese New Year in Singapore in 2010. Instead of the traditional 12 zodiac animals - rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig - McDonald&#x27;s replaced the pig symbol with a Cupid toy because Valentine&#x27;s Day fell on the same day as Chinese New Year in 2010 and because the restaurant&#x27;s Muslim customers do not consume pork. This paper aimed to find out how and why customers of McDonald&#x27;s rejected the zodiac promotion in Singapore through heated discussions in the media. Following a review of literature on multiculturalism, cultural sensitivity and hybrid cultural theories, a Foucault-based framework of discipline-ethics-performativity guided this qualitative text analysis of 97 documents from forum pages of the Straits Times newspaper and online postings on Asia One and Channel News Asia. Mass media asserted that it was a racial issue related to extreme political correctness that fuelled the controversy but the emerging theory was that there was a cultural territorial clash of discipline structures, ethical moderation, and identity performance. This paper contributes to literature on business in Asia, as there seems to be little research on pig symbolism in Marketing or on the failure of culturally oriented marketing activities. The implication for practice is that the marketing team needs to consider more carefully the fundamental cultural disciplinary structure, ethics responsibility, and identity performativity in a multi-ethnic country. While McDonald&#x27;s zodiac promotion appeared not to have upset the Muslims in multi-racial Singapore, it would be interesting to research whether there was any online backlash in Malaysia and Indonesia, which have a higher Muslim population. © 2013 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy..

ABSTRACT: Purpose: To conduct a scientometric analysis of the contents of the Journal of Business-to-Business Marketing from 1993 to 2014. Methodology/approach: The authors use the Leximancer computer-aided text analysis program, which reliably and reproducibly identifies the main concepts embedded in the text—their frequency and patterns of co-occurrence—based on the ways words move together in the text. They also identify key concepts that differentiate among the networks of concepts occurring in each of the first four five-year periods of the Journal’s history. Findings: There are four common underlying conceptual themes: relationships, market, study, and business. But the focal mix of concepts has changed over time, from a narrower initial focus on distribution and power and conflict, to a greater focus on firm business marketing strategy and pedagogy, to a focus on networks, the Internet and more collaborative relations, to a focus, in the most recent period, on psycho-social network concepts, such as trust and commitment. Research implications: The results complement and provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing researcher-conducted literature reviews of business marketing and JBBM’s contributions. The methodology provides possibilities for further analysis as it can be extended to analyze the business marketing and wider marketing literature more generally and how it has evolved. Practical implications: Leximancer provides a comprehensive, accessible summary of the content of the JBBM and demonstrates its value as a text analysis program. Originality/value/contribution: The authors are among the first to use this novel computer text analysis program to conduct a scientometric analyses of journal content. It provides a template for conducting studies of other journals and text.. business marketing evolution of business concepts Journal of Business-to-Business Marketing Leximancer relationships scientometric text analysis&#x27;, &#x27;Sponsorship Research: Drawing on the Past to Shape the Future of Sponsorship. This study examines how scholarly research on sponsorship has evolved between 1980 and July 2012. While various scholars (e.g., Cornwell and Maignan 1998; Pope 1998; Walliser 2003) have documented the progress of sponsorship research previously, this review departs from existing perspectives and redirects the conversation in the sponsorship literature by focusing attention on the semantic relationships among sponsorship concepts and the ways in which they have changed over time. Using Leximancer text-analysis software, we explore the emergence and growth of ideas and topics in sponsorship research by undertaking a systematic analysis of ideological trends. The research objectives of this study are: (1) to identify the scholarly trends through an empirical assessment of research across the history of sponsorship; and (2) based on the trends identified, to shape the future of sponsorship research. We collected titles and abstracts of articles in sponsorship presented in scholarly journals to July 2012. Guided by previous authors, we focused specifically on sourcing abstracts since abstracts encapsulate a concise summary of an article’s core issues and are therefore lexically dense (Cretchley et al. 2010). We sourced abstracts for our analyses from multiple databases (e.g., ISI Web of Science, Scopus, EconPapers (RePEc), PsycINFO and Google Scholar) and from over 150 marketing journals. We included abstracts from journals in languages other than English where English translations of the abstract were available electronically (Walliser 2003). In total, we collected 804 articles published across 144 scholarly journals. Next, we created subsets of the data in 10-year periods (1980-1989, 1990-1999, and 2000-2009), and one for 2010-2012. Using Leximancer software (Version 4.0), we produced a set of concept maps and reports showing semantic structures across the history of sponsorship for each of the four periods (see Smith and Humphreys 2006). The concept map of the entire corpus of abstracts revealed a core set of concepts that are recurrent and quite evenly distributed throughout the history of sponsorship. Sponsorship, marketing, objectives, value, strategy, companies, important, and key are concepts central to sponsorship’s intellectual identity. We identified two primal opposing but complementary forces around sponsorship measurement (e.g., consumers, awareness, brand, effects, image, impact, media, advertising) and sponsorship management (e.g., industry, benefits, rights, business, organizations, management, development, financial). Based on examination of the prominent concepts within each period, we defined the 1980s as the Intellectual Era (television, important, business, benefits, and advertising); the 1990s as the Ambushing Era (objectives, ambush, support, major, and corporate); the 2000s as the Consumer Era (products, financial, media, role, and market); and as the 2010s as the Relationships Era (professional, team, relationship, social and value). In the decade 2010-2019, we expect to observe the development and empirical exploration of more managerially focused models of sponsorship that center on better understanding the development of sponsorship strategy and the extraction of value from sponsorship investment. Going forward, the integration of social media as a sponsorship-marketing tool could also define a new era of research. In brief, adding a new data set to earlier reflections on sponsorship deepens our understanding of the role that key concepts and their inter-relationships have played in shaping sponsorship scholarship to date. We strongly believe the current study lends a high level of credibility to our insights about sponsorship’s past that can richly inform discussions about the future directions of sponsorship research..

Words are part of almost every marketplace interaction. Online reviews, customer service calls, press releases, marketing communications, and other interactions create a wealth of textual data. But how can marketers best use such data? This article provides an overview of automated textual analysis and details how it can be used to generate marketing insights. The authors discuss how text reflects qualities of the text producer (and the context in which the text was produced) and impacts the audience or text recipient. Next, they discuss how text can be a powerful tool both for prediction and for understanding (i.e., insights). Then, the authors overview methodologies and metrics used in text analysis, providing a set of guidelines and procedures. Finally, they further highlight some common metrics and challenges and discuss how researchers can address issues of internal and external validity. They conclude with a discussion of potential areas for future work. Along the way, the authors note how textual analysis can unite the tribes of marketing. While most marketing problems are interdisciplinary, the field is often fragmented. By involving skills and ideas from each of the subareas of marketing, text analysis has the potential to help unite the field with a common set of tools and approaches.. computational linguistics interdisciplinary machine learning marketing insight natural language processing text analysis text mining&#x27;, &#x27;Mining Arabic Twitter conversations on health care: a new approach to analysing Arabic language on social media. Purpose: This paper aims to equip professionals and researchers in the fields of advertising, branding, public relations, marketing communications, social media analytics and marketing with a simple, effective and dynamic means of evaluating consumer behavioural sentiments and engagement through Arabic language and script, in vivo. Design/methodology/approach: Using quantitative and qualitative situational linguistic analyses of Classical Arabic, found in Quranic and religious texts scripts; Modern Standard Arabic, which is commonly used in formal Arabic channels; and dialectical Arabic, which varies hugely from one Arabic country to another: this study analyses rich marketing and consumer messages (tweets) – as a basis for developing an Arabic language social media methodological tool. Findings: Despite the popularity of Arabic language communication on social media platforms across geographies, currently, comprehensive language processing toolkits for analysing Arabic social media conversations have limitations and require further development. Furthermore, due to its unique morphology, developing text understanding capabilities specific to the Arabic language poses challenges. Practical implications: This study demonstrates the application and effectiveness of the proposed methodology on a random sample of Twitter data from Arabic-speaking regions. Furthermore, as Arabic is the language of Islam, the study is of particular importance to Islamic and Muslim geographies, markets and marketing. Social implications: The findings suggest that the proposed methodology has a wider potential beyond the data set and health-care sector analysed, and therefore, can be applied to further markets, social media platforms and consumer segments. Originality/value: To remedy these gaps, this study presents a new methodology and analytical approach to investigating Arabic language social media conversations, which brings together a multidisciplinary knowledge of technology, data science and marketing communications..

Purpose: In Indonesia, subjective issues towards the fundamental of Islamic banks (IBs) have been arising. For example, they are claimed to be not in line with the Shari‘ah (Islamic law). Furthermore, the existing scholarly works have not much gained knowledge from the local IBs explaining their efforts in promoting maqasid al-Shariah (objectives of Islamic law). Hence, because religiosity drives the fundamental establishment of IBs, this paper aims to explore the knowledge of how IBs in Indonesia promote maqasid al-Shariah via their published reports. Design/methodology/approach: This paper performs text mining from 24 official reports of 5 IBs in Indonesia published from 2015 to 2017. The sample contains 7,162 digital pages and approximately 3,021,618 words. Traditional text mining via human intelligence is first performed to analyse for the numerical data required in the maqasid al-Shariah index (MSI) analysis. Furthermore, a computer-driven text mining using the ‘Text Search’ feature of NVivo 12 Plus is conducted to perform qualitative analysis. These approaches are made to gain relevant knowledge of how the sampled IBs promote maqasid al-Shariah from their published reports. Findings: The analysis using the MSI explains a quantified maqasid al-Shariah on the sample’s performance, which indictes the lowest and the highest performing banks. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis supports the evidence from the quantitative analysis. It explains the authors’ coding process that results in 2 parent nodes and 20 child nodes, which contain 435 references coded from the sampled unstructured and bilingual texts. These nodes explain the information that associates with maqasid al-Shariah from the IBs’ reports. These findings explain how maqasid al-Shariah is measured mathematically and represent relevant knowledge of how maqasid al-Shariah is informed practically via digital texts. Research limitations/implications: A positivist generalisation is neither intended nor established in this study. Practical implications: This paper gains relevant knowledge of how the sampled IBs in Indonesia control and maintain the implementation of maqasid al-Shariah from large textual data. Such knowledge is practically important for IBs stakeholders in Indonesia; moreover to help navigate the Shari‘ah identity of Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI), the new IB established from the merger of 3 state-owned IBs, which are among the sample of this study.

Sentiment is fundamental to human communication. Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called SiEBERT) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon.. Deep Contextual Language Models Machine Learning Meta-Analysis Natural Language Processing Sentiment Analysis Text Mining Transfer Learning&#x27;, &#x27;Complementing human effort in online reviews: A deep learning approach to automatic content generation and review synthesis. Online product reviews are ubiquitous and helpful sources of information available to consumers for making purchase decisions. Consumers rely on both the quantitative aspects of reviews such as valence and volume as well as textual descriptions to learn about product quality and fit. In this paper we show how new achievements in natural language processing can provide an important assist for different kinds of review-related writing tasks. Working in the interesting context of wine reviews, we demonstrate that machines are capable of performing the critical marketing task of writing expert reviews directly from a fairly small amount of product attribute data (metadata). We conduct a kind of “Turing Test” to evaluate human response to our machine-written reviews and show strong support for the assertion that machines can write reviews that are indistinguishable from those written by experts. Rather than replacing the human review writer, we envision a workflow wherein machines take the metadata as inputs and generate a human readable review as a first draft of the review and thereby assist an expert reviewer in writing their review. We next modify and apply our machine-writing technology to show how machines can be used to write a synthesis of a set of product reviews. For this last application we work in the context of beer reviews (for which there is a large set of available reviews for each of a large number of products) and produce machine-written review syntheses that do a good job – measured again through human evaluation – of capturing the ideas expressed in the reviews of any given beer. For each of these applications, we adapt the Transformer neural net architecture. The work herein is broadly applicable in marketing, particularly in the context of online reviews. We close with suggestions for additional applications of our model and approach as well as other directions for future research..

Today, climate change due to global warming is a significant concern to all of us. India&#x27;s rate of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing day by day, placing India in the top ten emitters in the world. Air pollution is one of the significant contributors to the greenhouse effect. Transportation contributes about 10% of the air pollution in India. The Indian government is taking steps to reduce air pollution by encouraging the use of electric vehicles. But, success depends on consumer&#x27;s sentiment, perception and understanding towards Electric Vehicles (EV). This case study tried to capture the feeling, attitude, and emotions of Indian consumers&#x27; towards electric vehicles. The main objective of this study was to extract opinions valuable to prospective buyers (to know what is best for them), marketers (for determining what features should be advertised) and manufacturers (for deciding what features should be improved) using Deep Learning techniques (e.g Doc2Vec Algorithm, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). Due to the very nature of social media data, big data platform was chosen to analyze the sentiment towards EV. Deep Learning based techniques were preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic regression and Decision tree, etc.) due to its superior text mining capabilities. Two years data (2016 to 2018) were collected from different social media platform for this case study.

The Role of Uses Gratifications and Privacy Concerns: An Abstract. Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVAs) are invading homes and workplaces all over the world. Continuance advancements and innovations with automation technologies such as Robotic Process Automation, Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing have boosted the global market of these devices. After first adoption, which could be fostered due to marketing and promotional campaigns and also users’ curiosity, the continuance usage of these tools is tremendously important to build a sustainable market and is therefore challenging for vendors. This article investigates the motivation to continue using these tools that could stem from the gratifications they afford to users. We are also interested in the constraints that hinder this behavior, especially privacy concerns, as IVAs are perceived as ‘open-ended’ and community-based devices (Ku et al. 2013). Building on three areas of research: information technology and information systems (IS/IT) continuance usage (Al-maghrabi et al. 2011; Zhou 2013), uses and gratifications theory (UGT) (Dolan et al. 2016; Ifinedo 2016) and privacy concerns (Ku et al. 2013; LaRose and Eastin 2002), we develop an original research model of IVAs continuance usage intention. Our focus will be put on home usage of IVAs, which excludes usage at professional settings (Burns and Igou 2019; Todorov et al. 2018). To test the model, an online survey is conducted within a sample of 258 IVAs’ users in France. Part least squared structural equation modeling is applied to analyze data. Results show that privacy concerns strongly and negatively affect continuance intention. This dependent construct is also positively and directly determined by subjective norms, perceived critical mass, and uses gratifications, i.e. utilitarian gratifications (social interactions and information seeking) and more significantly hedonic gratifications (entertainment and fashion). Besides, only subjective norms could be considered as antecedent factors to all our gratifications constructs. This study contributes to the literature on IVAs, UGT and privacy concerns. It also provides IVAs’ vendors with useful insights on how to retain their users.. Continuance intention to use Intelligent virtual assistant Privacy concerns Uses and gratifications theory&#x27;, &#x27;Special Session: Corporate Social Responsibility and AI: The Case of Fashion: An Abstract. This paper critically examines the ethical issues of current and predicted adoption of AI within fashion. AI is a branch of computer science that combines machine learning, logic and natural language processing to emulate human intelligence. By processing vast amounts of data and recognising patterns in the data, AI produces insights and analytics at or above human capability (IEEE 2017). It has been applied to fashion in trend forecasting, personalisation, customer interaction and the use of CGI models. For example, Amazon developed “Echo Look” which combines computer vision with predictive AI and human analysis to assess a consumer’s current wardrobe choices and provide recommendations of what to wear. Users can ask the machine to rate two different possible outfits in terms of current trends and actual appearance (Gibbs 2017). Online styling subscription Stitch Fix uses machine learning algorithms to determine its customers’ preferred styles and offer personalised recommendations. AI has also been developed to mimic the role of social media influencers and models. CGI character “Miquela” has 1.6 million Instagram followers, collaborates with luxury brands and launched her own clothing brand, but is not a real person. There is a dedicated digital modelling agency (Davis 2018). Such innovations are likely to further inflame the ongoing ethical debate about using digital technologies and virtual reality at the risk of opportunities for real people, for example diminishing already scarce opportunities for black models (Graham 2018), or introducing norms of artificial appearance and personal aesthetics impossible for ‘real’ people to achieve. AI has the potential to revolutionise fashion through greater precision, accuracy and effectiveness in decision-making, but at what cost? To what extent can and should AI replicate and replace human creativity and presence in an industry sector founded on human input in creating new trends? Yet, AI that predicts garment suitability and offers greater customisation for consumers may reduce waste and over-consumption (Snow 2017). Producing items which have greater relevance could reduce returns, markdowns and warehouse space, plus increase customer satisfaction and experience. Automating repetitive tasks could save money and time for greater value-added activities, for example through the use of chatbots for online customer service. This paper applies the lens of CSR to inform the debate on whether core fashion retailing functions can and should be replaced by AI. A CSR approach argues for businesses assuming social responsibilities beyond any economic, technical and legal obligations which constitute its existence, with the objective of reconciling economic, social and environmental objectives (Davis 1973).. AI CSR Ethics Fashion&#x27;, &#x27;Opportunities and Challenges Facing AI Voice-Based Assistants: Consumer Perceptions and Technology Realities: An Abstract. Where AI has become especially pivotal for users’ interactions is in the case of voice-based assistants (VAs), such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. From what is initially perceived as being a tool to play music, read out news reports and set timers, VAs have developed considerably in recent years and their functionality goes way beyond initial perceptions. For example, Amazon Alexa will be able to give out health advice to users in the United Kingdom as health-related questions will be automatically searched for using the official NHS website (MIT Technology Review, 2020). Some reports go as far to discuss how Amazon has plans to be able to run someone’s entire life from the Alexa on the basis that the systems are getting so sophisticated and the data being collected is so vast that the Alexa will be capable of predicting needs (Hao, 2019). Nevertheless, users still appear to be resistant to use VAs, with some even reluctant to engage with this technology entirely (PwC, 2018). Most of these constraints to VA adoption primarily relate to lack of trust, perceived data privacy and security concerns and lack of knowledge or understanding. Despite the benefits and opportunities of AI software, it is inherently limited by capabilities surrounding planning, reasoning, knowledge, natural language processing, ability to move and to empathise. It is this lack of emotional connection that is a fundamental component of users being less trusting towards AI voice-based assistants. This research investigates the role of emerging capabilities, privacy concerns and trust towards VAs using a mixed-methodology design. Results from the qualitative element of the study reveal that it is more about trusting the capabilities and functionalities than being scared over personal data. This theme will subsequently be examined further in a follow-up experimental study to examine the role of context towards these perceptions. The focus of the experimental design will subsequently consider the direct relationship between perceived behavioural control and intention to continue to use VAs with consideration into the indirect effects of privacy concerns and trust and the moderating role of perceived capabilities. The findings, thus far, show how VAs, as new technologies and leaders of machine learning capabilities, can enhance customer experiences, improve customer relationships and add value to firms. As privacy concerns are often dismissed, if customers benefit from the sharing of their information, yet their capabilities being under-appreciated, firms can focus attention to the high-quality functions of these devices to encourage their more frequent use..

Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory study is to propose a new methodological approach to investigate brand associations. More specifically, the study aims to show how brand associations can be identified and analysed in an online community of international consumers of fashion to determine the degree of matching with company-defined brand associations. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is two-pronged, integrating qualitative market research techniques with quantitative text mining. It was applied to determine types and perceptions of brand associations among fashion bloggers with reference to three leading Italian fashion houses. These were then compared to brand associations found in company-generated texts to measure the degree of matching. Findings: The results showed consistent brand associations across the three brands, as well as substantial matching with company-defined brand associations. In addition, the analysis revealed the presence of distinctive brand association themes that shed further light on how brand attributes were perceived by blog participants. Practical implications: The methods described can be used by managers to identify and reinforce favourable brand associations among consumers. This knowledge can then be applied towards developing and implementing effective brand strategies. Originality/value: The authors propose an interdisciplinary approach to investigate brand associations in online communities. It incorporates text mining and computer-assisted textual analysis as techniques borrowed from the field of linguistics which have thus far seen little application in marketing studies, but can nonetheless provide important insights for strategic brand management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited..

The rise of social media has provided firms with ample new opportunities to communicate their brands (Carlson et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2018). Additionally, because textual and audio-visual data on social media platforms can be preserved, the medium has become a valuable tool for providing insights and informing strategic brand management (Kim et al. 2019; Greco and Polli 2019). Within the overall social media communication environment, brand communities specifically provide unique insights, as they can enhance understanding regarding changes in consumer’s opinions and feeling and how they perceive and talk to each other about a brand (Kim and Lee 2019). Using automated text analysis and Berthon and his colleagues’ (2009) framework to classify the user-generated brand content, this study investigates consumer attitudes towards luxury products based on the online communication within a Facebook brand community. This study includes a sample size of 15,014 comments from 302 posts from a Facebook luxury fashion group. The analysis revealed several significant main and interaction effects. This included significant main effects of aesthetics on analytic thinking and tone. More importantly, a significant two-way interaction between aesthetic and ontology occurred on analytic thinking and tone. The study provides useful and interesting insights into the theory and practice of luxury branding. For marketers bringing luxury to the masses could ensure higher sales, however, the perceived loss of exclusivity experienced by the high aesthetic customers could negatively impact the brand’s image in the long run. Luxury brands could mitigate these negative feelings and fuel prolonged consumer engagement by providing other options that make this part of their target audience feel special. Since the high aesthetic consumers are generally well informed about a company’s products or services, brands should consider selecting these individuals for co-creation and product innovation design purposes. This will not only help in re-building the consumer-brand relationship but because of their status within the social group will likely add to enhanced positive social discourse. This work also adds to the luxury fashion literature by incorporating linguistic inquiry and word count as a research tool to investigating luxury brand discourse in online brand communities, confirming the influence of the social context and conclusions by Berthon et al. (2009) that multiple market segments for one luxury brand exist and that marketing strategies should be focused accordingly.. eWOM LIWC Luxury branding Social media&#x27;, &#x27;Ambush Marketing of the London Olympics: A Content Analysis. Global sporting events such as the Olympic Games attract significant amounts of sponsorship spend by companies that want to position their brands with such a high profile event. There are very few events that can achieve this on a truly global scale, but the Olympic Games are one of these events. However, it is also the case that these types of events attract ambush marketing as rival companies seek to have their brands associated with the Olympics, but at only a fraction of the cost. Ambush marketing has been termed associative marketing as the ambush marketer attempts to associate the brand with and event and trade off the goodwill associated with the event. Thus ambush marketing attempts to confuse the consumer into believing that the ambusher is a sponsor. Ambush marketing strategies include sponsoring media coverage of an event, sponsoring a sub-category of the event, consumer promotions, congratulatory messages, pourage agreements and corporate hospitality. However, Burton and Chadwick (2009) say ambush marketing has evolved, from mainly broadcast sponsorship campaigns and advertising at the events, to more creative and associative marketing efforts away from the event, to the use of spectators or fans to promote the brand. Although ambush marketing of such an event is not necessarily new, the 2012 London Olympics presented an intriguing research scenario because firstly it had the strictest anti-ambush legislation and enforcement policies of any other previous Games. In an attempt to protect the extensive sponsorship spend (in excess of £3.7 billion) required to host the London Olympic Games, a total of 24 statutory instruments and five acts of Parliament were brought into being including bans on the use of numerous words associated with the Olympics, including ‘Games’, ‘2012’ and combinations of ‘Gold’, ‘Summer’, ‘Medals’, ‘safe zones’ where sponsors have sole rights and aggressive onsite policing. Ambush marketing is no longer just a civil matter but a criminal one. Such strict control measures had the potential to both alienate the public as well as lull the sponsors into a false sense of security. The second aspect making the London Olympics an interesting research event was the strong social media presence. These Games were even described as the ‘digital games’. This paper looks at how effective this legislation was in practice given the strong social media presence, by undertaking a content analysis on text extracted from Google using the key word search term ‘london olympics ambush marketing’. A search was done every day for a month before, and the time during the Olympics. For each period all the articles were then combined into a single word document. A total of 406 354 words (1108 pages) were included in the data set for the ‘before’ period and 413 433 words (1008 pages) in the ‘during’ set. Leximancer, text mining software used to analyse (thematically and semantically) the content of textual documents and produce conceptual maps, was used for the data analysis. The Leximancer maps revealed that in the ‘month before’ analysis the main themes exhibit a strong focus on the highly regulated nature of the London Olympics and the extreme lengths that the IOC and LOCOG’s have gone to protect the official sponsors. The main themes during the Olympics while still emphasising the measures in place to protect the official sponsors, revealed an emergence of more discussion on the ambushers, with Nike and Dr Dre featuring prominently. Both these ambushers appear to have tiptoed around the IOC and LOCOG legislation and rules. The role of social media is highlighted. Comparing the data from the two periods, the research findings suggest that the legislation did curtail ambush marketing to some extent, although did not eliminate it. Despite concerns about a backlash from spectators and the possibility of negative publicity due to the strict controls, this did not appear to materialise. Furthermore, the nature of ambush marketing seems to have changed from a direct assault on the event, to more subtle ambushing techniques, also more difficult to predict. The hype surrounding the London Games as the ‘first truly’ digital Games, with the anticipated mass use of Social Media as an ambush medium of the Games did not materialise. This may have been due to the cooperation of the leading Social Media sites with Facebook banning advertising associated with the Games during the Olympics. Similarly, Twitter announced a ban any potential ambush tweets. The concept maps did pick up the theme of media for both before and during the Games with the central concept in both periods relating to Social Media. It is difficult to tell how effective the Games were for the official sponsors in terms of raising the profile of their brands. Only four brands were picked up by the concept maps, two official sponsors (Adidas and Coca Cola) and two unofficial sponsors (Nike and Beats). It would seem that sponsoring the Games does not get everyone talking about your brand. Limitations in this research are acknowledged..

Financial reporting and disclosure are important means for management to communicate firm performance and governance to external stakeholders. Existing research provides limited insight into firms’ disclosure of information about their market-based assets such as brands, although brand is an important part of firms’ value proposition. Our research intends to address this research gap through (1) a theory-based conceptualization of brand-related information (BRI) and (2) an empirical analysis of BRI disclosure in corporate reports, more specifically, in US firms’ annual reports on Form 10-K. We incorporate automated text analysis to identify and measure BRI disclosure in 10-K reports. Automated text analysis allows us to process massive amounts of text efficiently and reliably. Extant studies using automated text analysis are primarily rely on word-level analysis, yet most concepts entail multiword terms or phrases to convey meaning. We address this limitation of existing methods by applying phrase-level analysis to BRI disclosure. First, we draw on the literature on customer-based brand equity and intellectual capital disclosure to develop the conceptualization of BRI. Building on this conceptualization, we explore the capacity of natural language processing to build a phrase-level BRI coding dictionary. Second, we use automated text analysis to construct a BRI disclosure index that captures the BRI disclosure level in firms’ 10-K reports. Unlike prior studies that focus on word-level analysis for construct measurement, our method utilizes proximity search to match phrases in the BRI coding dictionary with texts and incorporate a proximity-weighing mechanism to conduct a phrase-level analysis of BRI disclosures. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, this study fills the research gap in the field of information disclosure concerning BRI by conceptualizing a BRI framework and providing evidence on whether and how firms disclose BRI in financial reporting. Second, our method broadens the possibility of utilizing automated text analysis in constructing research-specific coding dictionaries as well as conducting phrase-level text analysis. While current research has made some efforts to provide a structured process for phrase-level text analysis, there is limited guidance regarding the operationalization of phrase match with proximity search.. Automated text analysis Brand-related information Information disclosure Natural language processing Phrase-level analysis&#x27;, &#x27;Disclosure of Brand-Related Information and Firm Value: An Abstract. Research on voluntary disclosure highlights the role of informative financial reporting for capital markets. Information asymmetry impedes the efficient allocation of resources in capital markets while credible disclosure between managers and investors plays an important role in mitigating these problems. Existing research provides limited insight into firms’ disclosure of information about their market-based assets such as brands, although brand is an important part of firms’ value proposition. This study aims to fill this research gap by investigating brand-related information (BRI) disclosure in US firms’ annual reports with three research steps. First, we develop the conceptualization of BRI, based on which, we build a BRI coding dictionary. We then conduct text mining on 10-K reports and construct a BRI disclosure index to capture the BRI disclosure level in firms’ 10-K reports. In the third step, we intend to explore the key factors driving BRI disclosure as well as its financial market consequences. We propose to empirically investigate how different levels of BRI disclosure are explained by firm characteristics and actual brand performance. We will also examine how BRI disclosure influences firm value, as well as the role that BRI disclosure plays in explaining the relationship between brand performance and firm value. This study fills the research gap in the field of information disclosure concerning BRI by conceptualizing a BRI framework and providing evidence on whether firms disclose BRI in financial reporting. This study will also contribute to marketing-finance literature by empirically investigating the informational value of BRI disclosure to firm value. The findings will provide managers and financial market participants (e.g., analysts, investors) who need to communicate and evaluate the performance implications of branding strategies and related activities with enlightenment on the value relevance of BRI disclosures..

Purpose: The purpose of this study to examine the effect of financial constraint on intangible investment because intangible investment provides an overall picture of marketing investment and activity. Intangible investment also plays a significant role in facilitating future sales. Using a new measure of intangible investment (Peters and Taylor, 2017), the authors first establish that intangible investment is positively related with future sales. Then, using a new text-based measure of financial constraint, the authors show that financial constraint has a significant negative effect on future intangible investments after controlling for other factors. Intangible investment has three components. The first is R&amp;D, the second is 30 per cent of selling and general administrative expense (SGA) and the third is other intangibles. The authors find that the negative and significant effect of financial constraint on 30 per cent SGA is stronger. This indicates that financially constrained firms reduce marketing related investments. The authors then considered firm size and found that smaller firms facing financial constraint continue to increase their intangible investments, whereas larger firms reduce their intangible investment. As a robustness test, the authors use advertising expenditure as a measure of promotion related investment and find that financial constraint has a negative effect on advertising spending. The authors then use two traditional measures of financial constraint in their analysis to compare with the new text-based measure. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use ordinary least squares with cluster robust standard error to conduct their empirical analysis. Findings: First the authors establish that intangible investment positively affects future sales. Further the authors find that financial constraint negatively affects intangible investment. Moreover, financial constraint negatively affects the brand capital of intangible investment. Research limitations/implications: The authors did not conduct any industry specific analysis to see how financial constraints affect intangible investment across different industries. Industry specific analysis is important because in some industries/sectors intangibles are clearly more important than in others, so this is an important avenue for future research. It will also be interesting to explore if and how financial constraint has a mediating effect on sales growth via intangible investment and different components of intangibles. Practical implications: This study identifies another important factor that can negatively affect brand capital investment. Originality/value: The authors have used a measure of financial constraint and text mined all the annual reports of US firms for the period of 1994-2016 to compute this measure..

In recent years, the concept of sustainable consumption behavior (SCB) is largely introduced and changed continuously to be discussed with industries such as energy sector, agriculture, transportation, sharing economy, and tourism. However, the study of sustainable consumption behavior in the online education industry (SCBOEI) remains a research gap. Thus, this paper aims to identify the significance of sustainable consumption behavior and theoretically conceptualize SCBOEI. This study employs content and text analysis to reconceptualize the major theories that contribute to the research of SCB. The findings in this study show that SCBOEI is contributed of great significance to promote sustainable development. In addition, this study introduces a model of SCBOEI, in which the consumer value theory, social exchange theory, and planned behavior theory are integrated. Additionally, this paper suggests that value, environmental attitude, identity, consumer engagement, and contextual factors (government behavior, market conditions, and environmental education) are highly important to extend the research on SCBOEI. In conclusion, this study strongly recommends that SCB research shall be directed to the online education industry. Furthermore, future studies shall emphasize the empirical effects of psychological factors, activity factors, and contextual factors for SCBOEI to find the correlation..

Despite the broad interest and rapid increase in studying green consumer behaviour (GCB) from a social perspective, related articles have been presented in a piecemeal fashion and have lacked a review of social roles in GCB. Additionally, the research focus may differ from the influence of digital technology. Therefore, this study draws on a review of 439 GCB articles that focus on social roles and utilizes both quantitative and qualitative analyses to provide a general picture of theories, social factors, research topics and topic trends with a specific emphasis on the research differences between the traditional and digital contexts. The findings indicate that the GCB field has experienced exponential growth since 2014. Subjective norms, social influence, culture, marketing influence and social media influence are the main drivers of GCB. Eight research topics are identified, among which topics on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the theory of consumption values (TCV) maintained high popularity. Furthermore, the TPB is more prevalent in the traditional context in which scholars prefer to predict GCB using macrosocial factors, such as policy and culture. In comparison, signal theory and commitment-trust theory have received more attention in the digital context in which trust is vital. Research interests in online platforms and green hotels have recently increased in the digital context.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to (1) identify the sustainable practices developed by the textile and apparel industry and (2) investigate the gaps and opportunities in the sustainability implementation process by quantitively analyzing the sustainability topics and the relevant topic trends. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed text mining techniques. A total of 1,168 relevant magazine articles published from 2013 to 2020 were collected and then categorized according to their tones. In total, 36 topics were identified by reviewing the sustainability issues in the industry. The frequency of each topic mentioned in the articles and the correlation coefficients between topics&#x27; frequencies and published time were calculated. The results were used to examine if the three sustainability dimensions (environment, society, economy) were equally addressed and identify opportunities in the sustainability implementation process. Findings: There were much fewer social and economic topics than environmental topics discussed in the articles. Additionally, there were not enough practices developed to reduce microfiber pollution, improve consumers&#x27; knowledge of sustainability, offset the carbon footprint, build a transparent, sustainable supply chain and avoid animal cruelty. Originality/value: There is a lack of research focusing on the whole supply chain and sustainability when investigating sustainable practices and topic trends. This study fills a part of the gap.

Mining online reviews to understand the needs of adaptive clothing customers. The adaptive clothing market, which focuses on the inclusive design of clothing and footwear for people with varying degrees of disability, has grown substantially in recent years. However, few scholars have sought to understand the perspectives of online adaptive clothing consumers. This study employed topic modelling, sentiment analysis and collocation analysis to discover common themes and insights emerging from online customer reviews, scraped from a third-party review platform and three retailing web sites. We utilized customer value and functional, expressive and aesthetic theories to group the results from topic modelling into key themes. Clothing function is the most frequently discussed theme in online customer reviews, followed by customer service and clothing aesthetics. Collocation analysis revealed the cause underlying each theme vis-à-vis customer satisfaction (e.g., fit and material quality) and dissatisfaction (e.g., sewing defects and lost shipment). The findings contribute to understanding the clothing needs and wants of people living with disabilities. It also provides practical guidelines on product offerings and online service optimization for adaptive clothing retailers.. adaptive clothing online reviews sentiment analysis text analytics topic modelling&#x27;, &#x27;Past, present, and future research on self-service merchandising: a co-word and text mining approach. Purpose: This study aims to discern emerging trends and provide a longitudinal perspective on merchandising research by identifying relationships between merchandising-related subdomains/themes. Design/methodology/approach: This study sourced 657 merchandising-related articles published since 1960, from the Scopus database and 425 from Web of Science. After processing and normalizing the data, this study performed co-word and thematic network analyses. Taking a text mining approach, this study used topic modeling to identify a set of coherent topics characterized by the keywords of the articles. Findings: This study identified the following merchandising-related themes: branding, retail, consumer, behavior, modeling, textile and clothing industry and visual merchandising. Although visual merchandising was the first type of merchandising to be used in-store, only recently has it become an emerging topic in the academic literature. There has been a further trend over the past decade to understand the adoption of simulation technology, such as computer-aided design, particularly in supply chain management in the clothing industry. These and other findings contribute to the discussion of the merchandising concept, approached from an evolutionary perspective. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions of this study hold implications at the intersection of merchandising, sectors, new technologies, research methodologies and merchandising-practitioner education. Research trends suggest that, in the future, virtual reality and augmented reality using neuroscientific methods will be applied to the e-merchandising context. Practical implications: The different dimensions of merchandising can be used to leverage store managers’ decision-making process toward an integrated store-management strategy. In particular, by adopting loyalty merchandising tactics, the store can generate emotional attachment among consumers, who will perceive its value and services as unique, thanks to merchandising items designed specifically with that aim in mind. The stimulation of unplanned purchases, the strategic location of products and duration of each merchandising activity in the store, the digitalization of merchandising and the application of findings from neuroscience studies are some of the most relevant practical applications. Originality/value: This study provides the first-ever longitudinal review of the state of the art in merchandising research, taking a holistic perspective of this field of knowledge spanning a 60-year period. The work makes a valuable contribution to the development of the marketing discipline..

Purpose: Sporting goods retailing is a significant sector within the sport industry with the total revenue of this sector reaching $52.2 billion in 2018. Beset with formidable competition, sporting goods stores are compelled to augment their merchandise with service and improve retail quality. The purpose of this study is to investigate retail quality of sporting goods stores (RQSGS). Design/methodology/approach: Based on 27,793 online reviews of 1481 stores in the United States, this study used Leximancer 4.0, a text mining software, to identify critical retail quality dimensions associated with sporting goods stores, and further explored the most salient dimensions among different levels of ratings. Findings: Customer service and store aspects are the two higher-order dimensions of RQSGS; holistic experience, manager and staff are three themes under customer service, and product, B&amp;M store and online–offline integration are three themes under store aspects. Furthermore, extreme reviews focus more on customer service, whereas lukewarm reviews focus more on store aspects. Practical implications: Knowledgeable staff, managers and online–offline integration are instrumental in creating superior retail quality.

Purpose: Service technologies are transforming the business landscape rapidly. This paper aims to explore the current scope of research in regard to emerging service technologies by comparing the content of articles in academic journals with practitioner-oriented publication outlets. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 5,118 technology-related articles from service journals, service conferences, business journals and business magazines are analyzed. Text-mining on abstracts is used for the thematic and semantic analysis. Common research themes and their relationships are depicted in a two-dimensional structured network. Further, the sample is analyzed regarding various technologies mentioned in the Gartner Hype Cycle. Findings: The paper reveals differences in academic and business perspectives in regard to service technologies. In comparison to business journals, scientific service research is more focused on customer-related aspects of technology. Service research has a less concrete focus on technology than in business publications. Still, service conference articles show a broader scope of emerging service technologies than academic journal articles. Research limitations/implications: Scientific research should focus on more concrete service technologies. Business magazines serve as a good source for that and the paper identifies several promising new technology fields. Practical implications: Although business magazines cover significantly more concrete service technologies, they miss the integrated perspective that academic articles usually offer. Academia can help business to better align concrete technologies with different internal and external perspectives. Originality/value: This paper serves as an introduction to the special issue Future Service Technologies. Additionally, a quantitative study of recent service technology research serves as a reality check for academic researchers on business reality and provides research and practical recommendations.. Digital Digital economy Future Leximancer Self-service technology Technology adoption Text-mining&#x27;, &#x27;Making sense of customer service experiences: a text mining review. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the concepts and theories underlying customer service experience (CSE) and its underlying five dimensions (physical, social, cognitive, affective and sensorial). In this research, the contribution of the sensorial dimension to CSE research is emphasized. Senses are especially important in forming perceptions within servicescapes that are typically rich in sensory stimuli. Design/methodology/approach: This study systematically identifies 258 articles published between 1994 and 2018 in services and marketing journals. The analysis uses a text mining approach with the Leximancer software to extract research concepts and their relationships. Findings: The results demonstrate a shift from CSE research focused on brands and products toward value and interaction, around three focal areas: service system architecture, with its value creation processes; servicescape, with an increasingly digital interaction interface and outcome measures, with a stronger focus on emotional and relational metrics. In CSE research, the physical, social and cognitive dimensions are mostly researched in the focal areas of servicescape and outcome measures. Although important in practice, the sensorial dimension is the least investigated CSE dimension in service marketing research. Text mining insights demonstrate rich opportunities for sensorial research, particularly in studies on servicescape. Practical implications: The synthesis will inform managers and service providers which elements of CSE are most relevant to customers when forming perceptions. These insights help service providers to control, manage and design (multi)-sensory stimuli that influence how customers will make sense of the servicescape. Originality/value: This research is one of the first studies to examine the conceptual structure of CSE with a text mining approach that systematically analyzes a large set of articles, therein reducing the potential for researchers’ interpretative bias. The paper provides an assessment of the role of the largely neglected but crucial sensorial dimension, and offers future research suggestions into this emerging topic.. Customer experience Leximancer Multisensory Review Sensory Service research Servicescape Text mining&#x27;, &#x27;A continuum of transformative service exchange: insights for service and social marketers. Purpose: Transformative service research (TSR) and social marketing share a common goal, which is to institute social change that improves individual and societal well-being. However, the mechanism via which such improved well-being results or so-called “transformation” occurs, is not well understood. The purpose of this paper is to examine the claims made in the TSR literature to identity the themes and scholarly meaning of “transformative” service exchange; ascertain the mechanisms used in service contexts to realize transformation, including to motivate long-term, sustainable societal change; and develop a transformative service exchange continuum to guide research and managerial approaches that aim to create uplifting social change. The authors recommend their continuum as a framework to inform how social marketing and service scholars design service solutions to address wicked social problems. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a qualitative study where Leximancer, a text-mining tool, is used to visualize the structure of themes and concepts that define transformative service exchanges as explained and applied in the literature. Additionally, a profiling analysis of transformation as it is discussed in the TSR literature is used to identify the mechanisms that service marketers have developed to establish current theorization of service thinking for social change. These qualitative phases of analysis then inform the development of the transformative service exchange continuum. Findings: A scoping review identified 51 articles across 12 journals, based on this study’s selection criteria for identifying transformative service exchanges. The Leximancer analysis systematically and efficiently guided the authors’ interpretation of the large data corpus and was used in the identification of service themes. The use of text-mining software afforded a detailed lens to enrich the authors’ interpretation and clarification of six high-level concepts for inclusion on a transformative service exchange continuum. Originality/value: This paper aims to unpack the meaning of transformative service exchange by highlighting the mechanism(s) used by researchers when designing social change outcomes. It contributes to TSR via the development of the continuum across micro, meso and macro levels. The temporal nature of transformative service exchanges is also elucidated. This continuum integrates current TSR studies and can guide future service studies in the TSR and social marketing domains..
