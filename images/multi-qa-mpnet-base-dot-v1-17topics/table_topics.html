Experts’ reviews shape consumer’s preferences and purchase decisions because they are often perceived as unbiased and trustworthy. Wine industry is a high value agricultural industry from the perspectives of both the main raw agricultural and the value added in the finished products. As a high value industry to both governments and consumers, countries spend billions on marketing their agricultural industries to not only their own citizens but also foreign citizens all over the world including these experts to establish a good product reputation. This paper examines the role of country of origin in expert eWOM (ratings and reviews) through large dataset from the global wine industry. Furthermore, we processed the review content by applying a structured automated text analysis program Diction. The result of ANOVA test demonstrates that there are significant differences between countries in terms of price, rating, and all the Diction content dimensions at the p\xa0&amp;lt;\xa00.001. We also find significant effects on wine quality ratings of price, country of origin, and review of content by conducting regression analysis. Indicated by the size of effect on ratings, expert reviewers use price as signal of quality when they provide eWOM. Country image significantly influences their review in most cases exception of Australia and France. USA variable is non-significant when considered alone but is significant when considered with price. France variable is non-significant with price included in the regression but has a significant bonus in ratings when not considering the effect of price. The Australia variable was non-significant in all regression analysis indicating that there was Australian wine ratings were not statistically different than minor wine producing countries. This paper provides several contributions in the field of expert eWOM and country of origin literatures. Wine producer in prestigious wine producing countries such as Germany and Italy can extract a price premium related to the country that is perceived by expert as high quality. However, producers in less prestigious wine producing countries (e.g., South African or Chilean) can signal quality through a higher price that can help them overcome the country image bias and aid the perception by experts of high quality, and they can also take advantage of the low price segment of consumers. Producers can also manage expert eWOM by priming these reviewers to use more active, certain, optimistic language in reviews to increase quality ratings. Furthermore, governments and industry associations can encourage experts to writes reviews with active, optimistic and central language to have an influence on quality rating, and thus develop country images.. eWOM bias Expert reviews Intext-mining Wine&#x27;, &#x27;Differences in Online Review Content between Old and New Products: An Abstract. Online product reviews are one of the most important sources of information that influences the consumer decision making process. Studies have shown a positive relationship between online reviews and product sales. Not surprisingly, extant research has studied the factors that influence reviews such as include reviewer credibility and review content, review volume, valence, and dispersion, the impact of negative versus positive reviews, and the influence of product category. Despite the important influence of online reviews on consumer decision making, there are several key empirical and theoretical questions in the domain of online reviews that remain unanswered. Extensive research on online reviews has been taken place for movies, books, and television shows. There has been relatively limited research into reviews for new products in other, less well-known product categories. In addition, most research has focused on the volume, valence, and variance of reviews. Research investigating review content is emerging, although much of this research is based on standard attributes of the text using packages like LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count). Research investigating more specific aspects of review content is less prevalent. Finally, there have been several studies focused on the impact of online reviews on new products sales and review-based mining to get the pricing power of different attributes. However, these inquiries have not taken into consideration how reviews for new products differ from reviews for similar products that already exist and are available online. The aim of this paper is to compare content of online reviews for new and established products. We seek to understand how consumers evaluate old and new products in the same category based on online reviews and whether there are systematic differences in the type of content discussed for each type of product. We use Amazon review data from two categories to compare review content for a new product and the leading established product in each category. The present study serves as a pilot to examine the efficacy of machine-based coding of product reviews along a number of relevant dimensions and probe for potential differences to inform future research. We find that there is a difference in the way consumers review old and new products in a category. The reviews of new products are highly descriptive and detailed with experiences shared by the users. Additionally, when we look at the attribute-wise impact on the ratings, it is found that attributes that are common to both seem to have a higher impact on the ratings than attributes which stand out in the new products..

Global sporting events such as the Olympic Games attract significant amounts of sponsorship spend by companies that want to position their brands with such a high profile event. There are very few events that can achieve this on a truly global scale, but the Olympic Games are one of these events. However, it is also the case that these types of events attract ambush marketing as rival companies seek to have their brands associated with the Olympics, but at only a fraction of the cost. Ambush marketing has been termed associative marketing as the ambush marketer attempts to associate the brand with and event and trade off the goodwill associated with the event. Thus ambush marketing attempts to confuse the consumer into believing that the ambusher is a sponsor. Ambush marketing strategies include sponsoring media coverage of an event, sponsoring a sub-category of the event, consumer promotions, congratulatory messages, pourage agreements and corporate hospitality. However, Burton and Chadwick (2009) say ambush marketing has evolved, from mainly broadcast sponsorship campaigns and advertising at the events, to more creative and associative marketing efforts away from the event, to the use of spectators or fans to promote the brand. Although ambush marketing of such an event is not necessarily new, the 2012 London Olympics presented an intriguing research scenario because firstly it had the strictest anti-ambush legislation and enforcement policies of any other previous Games. In an attempt to protect the extensive sponsorship spend (in excess of £3.7 billion) required to host the London Olympic Games, a total of 24 statutory instruments and five acts of Parliament were brought into being including bans on the use of numerous words associated with the Olympics, including ‘Games’, ‘2012’ and combinations of ‘Gold’, ‘Summer’, ‘Medals’, ‘safe zones’ where sponsors have sole rights and aggressive onsite policing. Ambush marketing is no longer just a civil matter but a criminal one. Such strict control measures had the potential to both alienate the public as well as lull the sponsors into a false sense of security. The second aspect making the London Olympics an interesting research event was the strong social media presence. These Games were even described as the ‘digital games’. This paper looks at how effective this legislation was in practice given the strong social media presence, by undertaking a content analysis on text extracted from Google using the key word search term ‘london olympics ambush marketing’. A search was done every day for a month before, and the time during the Olympics. For each period all the articles were then combined into a single word document. A total of 406 354 words (1108 pages) were included in the data set for the ‘before’ period and 413 433 words (1008 pages) in the ‘during’ set. Leximancer, text mining software used to analyse (thematically and semantically) the content of textual documents and produce conceptual maps, was used for the data analysis. The Leximancer maps revealed that in the ‘month before’ analysis the main themes exhibit a strong focus on the highly regulated nature of the London Olympics and the extreme lengths that the IOC and LOCOG’s have gone to protect the official sponsors. The main themes during the Olympics while still emphasising the measures in place to protect the official sponsors, revealed an emergence of more discussion on the ambushers, with Nike and Dr Dre featuring prominently. Both these ambushers appear to have tiptoed around the IOC and LOCOG legislation and rules. The role of social media is highlighted. Comparing the data from the two periods, the research findings suggest that the legislation did curtail ambush marketing to some extent, although did not eliminate it. Despite concerns about a backlash from spectators and the possibility of negative publicity due to the strict controls, this did not appear to materialise. Furthermore, the nature of ambush marketing seems to have changed from a direct assault on the event, to more subtle ambushing techniques, also more difficult to predict. The hype surrounding the London Games as the ‘first truly’ digital Games, with the anticipated mass use of Social Media as an ambush medium of the Games did not materialise. This may have been due to the cooperation of the leading Social Media sites with Facebook banning advertising associated with the Games during the Olympics. Similarly, Twitter announced a ban any potential ambush tweets. The concept maps did pick up the theme of media for both before and during the Games with the central concept in both periods relating to Social Media. It is difficult to tell how effective the Games were for the official sponsors in terms of raising the profile of their brands. Only four brands were picked up by the concept maps, two official sponsors (Adidas and Coca Cola) and two unofficial sponsors (Nike and Beats). It would seem that sponsoring the Games does not get everyone talking about your brand. Limitations in this research are acknowledged..

Financial reporting and disclosure are important means for management to communicate firm performance and governance to external stakeholders. Existing research provides limited insight into firms’ disclosure of information about their market-based assets such as brands, although brand is an important part of firms’ value proposition. Our research intends to address this research gap through (1) a theory-based conceptualization of brand-related information (BRI) and (2) an empirical analysis of BRI disclosure in corporate reports, more specifically, in US firms’ annual reports on Form 10-K. We incorporate automated text analysis to identify and measure BRI disclosure in 10-K reports. Automated text analysis allows us to process massive amounts of text efficiently and reliably. Extant studies using automated text analysis are primarily rely on word-level analysis, yet most concepts entail multiword terms or phrases to convey meaning. We address this limitation of existing methods by applying phrase-level analysis to BRI disclosure. First, we draw on the literature on customer-based brand equity and intellectual capital disclosure to develop the conceptualization of BRI. Building on this conceptualization, we explore the capacity of natural language processing to build a phrase-level BRI coding dictionary. Second, we use automated text analysis to construct a BRI disclosure index that captures the BRI disclosure level in firms’ 10-K reports. Unlike prior studies that focus on word-level analysis for construct measurement, our method utilizes proximity search to match phrases in the BRI coding dictionary with texts and incorporate a proximity-weighing mechanism to conduct a phrase-level analysis of BRI disclosures. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, this study fills the research gap in the field of information disclosure concerning BRI by conceptualizing a BRI framework and providing evidence on whether and how firms disclose BRI in financial reporting. Second, our method broadens the possibility of utilizing automated text analysis in constructing research-specific coding dictionaries as well as conducting phrase-level text analysis. While current research has made some efforts to provide a structured process for phrase-level text analysis, there is limited guidance regarding the operationalization of phrase match with proximity search.. Automated text analysis Brand-related information Information disclosure Natural language processing Phrase-level analysis&#x27;, &#x27;Financial constraints and marketing investment: evidence from text analysis. Purpose: The purpose of this study to examine the effect of financial constraint on intangible investment because intangible investment provides an overall picture of marketing investment and activity. Intangible investment also plays a significant role in facilitating future sales. Using a new measure of intangible investment (Peters and Taylor, 2017), the authors first establish that intangible investment is positively related with future sales. Then, using a new text-based measure of financial constraint, the authors show that financial constraint has a significant negative effect on future intangible investments after controlling for other factors. Intangible investment has three components. The first is R&amp;D, the second is 30 per cent of selling and general administrative expense (SGA) and the third is other intangibles. The authors find that the negative and significant effect of financial constraint on 30 per cent SGA is stronger. This indicates that financially constrained firms reduce marketing related investments. The authors then considered firm size and found that smaller firms facing financial constraint continue to increase their intangible investments, whereas larger firms reduce their intangible investment. As a robustness test, the authors use advertising expenditure as a measure of promotion related investment and find that financial constraint has a negative effect on advertising spending. The authors then use two traditional measures of financial constraint in their analysis to compare with the new text-based measure. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use ordinary least squares with cluster robust standard error to conduct their empirical analysis. Findings: First the authors establish that intangible investment positively affects future sales. Further the authors find that financial constraint negatively affects intangible investment. Moreover, financial constraint negatively affects the brand capital of intangible investment. Research limitations/implications: The authors did not conduct any industry specific analysis to see how financial constraints affect intangible investment across different industries. Industry specific analysis is important because in some industries/sectors intangibles are clearly more important than in others, so this is an important avenue for future research. It will also be interesting to explore if and how financial constraint has a mediating effect on sales growth via intangible investment and different components of intangibles. Practical implications: This study identifies another important factor that can negatively affect brand capital investment. Originality/value: The authors have used a measure of financial constraint and text mined all the annual reports of US firms for the period of 1994-2016 to compute this measure.. Brand capital Financial constraints Intangible investments Marketing investments Text analysis&#x27;, &#x27;Disclosure of Brand-Related Information and Firm Value: An Abstract. Research on voluntary disclosure highlights the role of informative financial reporting for capital markets. Information asymmetry impedes the efficient allocation of resources in capital markets while credible disclosure between managers and investors plays an important role in mitigating these problems. Existing research provides limited insight into firms’ disclosure of information about their market-based assets such as brands, although brand is an important part of firms’ value proposition. This study aims to fill this research gap by investigating brand-related information (BRI) disclosure in US firms’ annual reports with three research steps. First, we develop the conceptualization of BRI, based on which, we build a BRI coding dictionary. We then conduct text mining on 10-K reports and construct a BRI disclosure index to capture the BRI disclosure level in firms’ 10-K reports. In the third step, we intend to explore the key factors driving BRI disclosure as well as its financial market consequences. We propose to empirically investigate how different levels of BRI disclosure are explained by firm characteristics and actual brand performance. We will also examine how BRI disclosure influences firm value, as well as the role that BRI disclosure plays in explaining the relationship between brand performance and firm value. This study fills the research gap in the field of information disclosure concerning BRI by conceptualizing a BRI framework and providing evidence on whether firms disclose BRI in financial reporting. This study will also contribute to marketing-finance literature by empirically investigating the informational value of BRI disclosure to firm value. The findings will provide managers and financial market participants (e.g., analysts, investors) who need to communicate and evaluate the performance implications of branding strategies and related activities with enlightenment on the value relevance of BRI disclosures..

Purpose: This study aims to discern emerging trends and provide a longitudinal perspective on merchandising research by identifying relationships between merchandising-related subdomains/themes. Design/methodology/approach: This study sourced 657 merchandising-related articles published since 1960, from the Scopus database and 425 from Web of Science. After processing and normalizing the data, this study performed co-word and thematic network analyses. Taking a text mining approach, this study used topic modeling to identify a set of coherent topics characterized by the keywords of the articles. Findings: This study identified the following merchandising-related themes: branding, retail, consumer, behavior, modeling, textile and clothing industry and visual merchandising. Although visual merchandising was the first type of merchandising to be used in-store, only recently has it become an emerging topic in the academic literature. There has been a further trend over the past decade to understand the adoption of simulation technology, such as computer-aided design, particularly in supply chain management in the clothing industry. These and other findings contribute to the discussion of the merchandising concept, approached from an evolutionary perspective. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions of this study hold implications at the intersection of merchandising, sectors, new technologies, research methodologies and merchandising-practitioner education. Research trends suggest that, in the future, virtual reality and augmented reality using neuroscientific methods will be applied to the e-merchandising context. Practical implications: The different dimensions of merchandising can be used to leverage store managers’ decision-making process toward an integrated store-management strategy. In particular, by adopting loyalty merchandising tactics, the store can generate emotional attachment among consumers, who will perceive its value and services as unique, thanks to merchandising items designed specifically with that aim in mind. The stimulation of unplanned purchases, the strategic location of products and duration of each merchandising activity in the store, the digitalization of merchandising and the application of findings from neuroscience studies are some of the most relevant practical applications. Originality/value: This study provides the first-ever longitudinal review of the state of the art in merchandising research, taking a holistic perspective of this field of knowledge spanning a 60-year period. The work makes a valuable contribution to the development of the marketing discipline..

This paper critically examines the ethical issues of current and predicted adoption of AI within fashion. AI is a branch of computer science that combines machine learning, logic and natural language processing to emulate human intelligence. By processing vast amounts of data and recognising patterns in the data, AI produces insights and analytics at or above human capability (IEEE 2017). It has been applied to fashion in trend forecasting, personalisation, customer interaction and the use of CGI models. For example, Amazon developed “Echo Look” which combines computer vision with predictive AI and human analysis to assess a consumer’s current wardrobe choices and provide recommendations of what to wear. Users can ask the machine to rate two different possible outfits in terms of current trends and actual appearance (Gibbs 2017). Online styling subscription Stitch Fix uses machine learning algorithms to determine its customers’ preferred styles and offer personalised recommendations. AI has also been developed to mimic the role of social media influencers and models. CGI character “Miquela” has 1.6 million Instagram followers, collaborates with luxury brands and launched her own clothing brand, but is not a real person. There is a dedicated digital modelling agency (Davis 2018). Such innovations are likely to further inflame the ongoing ethical debate about using digital technologies and virtual reality at the risk of opportunities for real people, for example diminishing already scarce opportunities for black models (Graham 2018), or introducing norms of artificial appearance and personal aesthetics impossible for ‘real’ people to achieve. AI has the potential to revolutionise fashion through greater precision, accuracy and effectiveness in decision-making, but at what cost? To what extent can and should AI replicate and replace human creativity and presence in an industry sector founded on human input in creating new trends? Yet, AI that predicts garment suitability and offers greater customisation for consumers may reduce waste and over-consumption (Snow 2017). Producing items which have greater relevance could reduce returns, markdowns and warehouse space, plus increase customer satisfaction and experience. Automating repetitive tasks could save money and time for greater value-added activities, for example through the use of chatbots for online customer service. This paper applies the lens of CSR to inform the debate on whether core fashion retailing functions can and should be replaced by AI. A CSR approach argues for businesses assuming social responsibilities beyond any economic, technical and legal obligations which constitute its existence, with the objective of reconciling economic, social and environmental objectives (Davis 1973).. AI CSR Ethics Fashion&#x27;, &#x27;Building a sustainable brand image in luxury fashion companies. Building a sustainable brand image for a luxury fashion company is a very complex and tangled marketing process. Brand image is a set of perceptions and beliefs surrounding a particular brand fixed in the mind of the consumer. It represents the result of the associations that the consumer recognizes in a brand and summarizes the positioning, personality and reputation of the brand itself. Companies can derive fundamental insights by analysing the associations and how they are formed and, in particular, whether they are related to their positioning choices. In the luxury fashion business, brand image communication is often delegated to offline events to convey specific values, ideals and messages to consumers and build brand associations. The Salvatore Ferragamo Museum, in particular, with its &quot;Sustainable Thinking&quot; exhibition, is seen as the emblem of this vision, the goal of which is to deliver a specific concept of a sustainable brand image to its customers. The objective of this empirical research was to seek correspondences or discrepancies between consumer brand perceptions and the identity conveyed by the Ferragamo brand in terms of sustainability. By using a netnographic and text mining methodology we found that the consumer associates the brand with a company committed to the environment and involved in social issues; a company that traditionally shows creative and experimental skills, using unusual materials, artisanry, innovative techniques and unique designs. The image that the company wants to convey, however, also includes other characterizations. Specifically, the company considers the &quot;Made in Italy&quot; aspect, the importance of its history and its family identity as decisive associations. These are all elements that, as far as this survey is concerned, were not found in the consumer perspective. As a result, from the comparison between the brand associations of both subjects, gaps emerge on which the company must intervene by designing new communication strategies or correcting existing ones in order to improve brand image and the overall brand value in terms of sustainability..

This paper aimed to find out how and why customers of McDonald&#x27;s rejected the zodiac promotion in Singapore through heated discussions in the media. Following a review of literature on multiculturalism, cultural sensitivity and hybrid cultural theories, a Foucault-based framework of discipline-ethics-performativity guided this qualitative text analysis of 97 documents from forum pages of the Straits Times newspaper and online postings on Asia One and Channel News Asia. Mass media asserted that it was a racial issue related to extreme political correctness that fuelled the controversy but the emerging theory was that there was a cultural territorial clash of discipline structures, ethical moderation, and identity performance. This paper contributes to literature on business in Asia, as there seems to be little research on pig symbolism in Marketing or on the failure of culturally oriented marketing activities. The implication for practice is that the marketing team needs to consider more carefully the fundamental cultural disciplinary structure, ethics responsibility, and identity performativity in a multi-ethnic country. While McDonald&#x27;s zodiac promotion appeared not to have upset the Muslims in multi-racial Singapore, it would be interesting to research whether there was any online backlash in Malaysia and Indonesia, which have a higher Muslim population. © 2013 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy..

This session brings together academics, consultants, and government professionals to discuss ways marketing can help address needs in a natural disaster. Extreme weather events have increased the visibility of marketing’s importance in relief and recovery solutions well beyond disaster fundraising. Effective Rapid Response Marketing (RRM) is critical. The dynamic and rapidly increasing developments in technology from apps to social media to machine learning and text mining can help marketers develop better Rapid Response Marketing in any crisis situation. The first presentation, “G2G Marketing from Crisis to Resolution: Marketing for When the Government Must Target the Government” (Linda Golden, Robert Peterson), introduces the concept of government-to-government (G2G) marketing and public policy marketing (PPM). Government agencies can be clients and suppliers to each other at different times, and states may compete for “their share” of federal funds. Marketing approaches and contributions are discussed. The second presentation (Alissa Walsh, Christopher Emrich, Marco Bravo) introduces the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) to marketing and discusses its use in disaster management by facilitating directed marketing toward needs of the most vulnerable groups in disaster situations. The third presentation (Rajiv Garg, Patrick Brockett, Linda Golden, Yuxin Zhang) shows how techniques like machine learning, geospatial information, and social media text mining can assist in rapid assessment of damage and affected areas and populations before or as the disaster unfolds. The fourth presentation (Peter Nance, Pete Phillips) shows how integrated marketing communication (IMC) is critical in disaster response and recovery. Messaging must be strategically developed and delivered before, during, and after a crisis. The final presentation (Colleen Jones, Alexandra Gamble) gives real examples of how the Texas General Land Office, charged with disaster resilience and recovery, implements marketing techniques to accomplish strategic goals and action plans. Recent hurricanes provide examples. References Available Upon Request. NA&#x27;, &#x27;Rapid Assessment of Customer Marketplace in Disaster Settings through Machine Learning, Geospatial Information, and Social Media Text Mining: An Abstract. In disasters there is a need to rapidly assess and predict impact area boundaries (for staging emergency relief and product distribution dynamics), delineate and communicate with the affected public (for coordinated disaster assistance such as evacuation, search and rescue, prioritization of manpower and equipment usage, etc.), and provide cost estimation for potential use in government-to-government (G2G) marketing (Golden and Peterson 2018) soliciting relief and assistance funds from federal and/or state authorities. This rapid assessment needs to occur as the disaster unfolds and immediately after the disaster, even while data is scarce and emerging. Marketing communication techniques and modern information technology methods (machine learning, geospatial information, and social media text mining) can help with these tasks. This paper shows how to use predictive modeling and geospatial interpolation along with machine learning for pre-disaster community planning, for risk management actions during the disaster, and for assisting in creating informed structure regulations to assist in disaster resilience. As disaster response is an ongoing process, the technique provides a framework of spatial level loss estimation using limited evolving data and iteratively improves estimation as more data becomes available. Predictive and probabilistic modeling starts with historical data (compiled before the event) including data such as damage to a specific building type as a function of water depth or wind speed. Topography of the land involved is assessed using satellite and LIDAR data and publically available flood maps created by FEMA for the National Flood Insurance Program and topographic maps produced in the US Topo project of the National Geospatial Program of the US Geological Survey (USGS). These baseline GIS datasets are overlaid with GIS-located data on building type and construction materials and usage scraped from county tax assessor websites. After buildings are GIS mapped, the FEMA’s HAZUS algorithm is used to estimate damages to each building as a function of projected area water depth. The water depth projection is determined by regression using wind speed and recurrence interval (i.e., Hurricane Harvey in Texas in 2017 was a 1 in 1,000 year event). As data becomes gradually available, we iteratively update estimates for areas using spatial interpolation. This informs communication modes of contact. To better assess impact area and population at risk with limited data, machine learning is applied. In disasters people often are active on mobile phones. GIS located text mining messages reveals who needs what and where, directs rescue, and improve damage estimates when data is sparse, and allow target messaging to vulnerable populations (Lazreg et al. 2016).

Purpose: Transformative service research (TSR) and social marketing share a common goal, which is to institute social change that improves individual and societal well-being. However, the mechanism via which such improved well-being results or so-called “transformation” occurs, is not well understood. The purpose of this paper is to examine the claims made in the TSR literature to identity the themes and scholarly meaning of “transformative” service exchange; ascertain the mechanisms used in service contexts to realize transformation, including to motivate long-term, sustainable societal change; and develop a transformative service exchange continuum to guide research and managerial approaches that aim to create uplifting social change. The authors recommend their continuum as a framework to inform how social marketing and service scholars design service solutions to address wicked social problems. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a qualitative study where Leximancer, a text-mining tool, is used to visualize the structure of themes and concepts that define transformative service exchanges as explained and applied in the literature. Additionally, a profiling analysis of transformation as it is discussed in the TSR literature is used to identify the mechanisms that service marketers have developed to establish current theorization of service thinking for social change. These qualitative phases of analysis then inform the development of the transformative service exchange continuum. Findings: A scoping review identified 51 articles across 12 journals, based on this study’s selection criteria for identifying transformative service exchanges. The Leximancer analysis systematically and efficiently guided the authors’ interpretation of the large data corpus and was used in the identification of service themes. The use of text-mining software afforded a detailed lens to enrich the authors’ interpretation and clarification of six high-level concepts for inclusion on a transformative service exchange continuum. Originality/value: This paper aims to unpack the meaning of transformative service exchange by highlighting the mechanism(s) used by researchers when designing social change outcomes. It contributes to TSR via the development of the continuum across micro, meso and macro levels. The temporal nature of transformative service exchanges is also elucidated. This continuum integrates current TSR studies and can guide future service studies in the TSR and social marketing domains.. Qualitative research Service ecosystem Social marketing Transformative&#x27;, &#x27;Future service technologies: is service research on track with business reality?. Purpose: Service technologies are transforming the business landscape rapidly. This paper aims to explore the current scope of research in regard to emerging service technologies by comparing the content of articles in academic journals with practitioner-oriented publication outlets. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 5,118 technology-related articles from service journals, service conferences, business journals and business magazines are analyzed. Text-mining on abstracts is used for the thematic and semantic analysis. Common research themes and their relationships are depicted in a two-dimensional structured network. Further, the sample is analyzed regarding various technologies mentioned in the Gartner Hype Cycle. Findings: The paper reveals differences in academic and business perspectives in regard to service technologies. In comparison to business journals, scientific service research is more focused on customer-related aspects of technology. Service research has a less concrete focus on technology than in business publications. Still, service conference articles show a broader scope of emerging service technologies than academic journal articles. Research limitations/implications: Scientific research should focus on more concrete service technologies. Business magazines serve as a good source for that and the paper identifies several promising new technology fields. Practical implications: Although business magazines cover significantly more concrete service technologies, they miss the integrated perspective that academic articles usually offer. Academia can help business to better align concrete technologies with different internal and external perspectives. Originality/value: This paper serves as an introduction to the special issue Future Service Technologies. Additionally, a quantitative study of recent service technology research serves as a reality check for academic researchers on business reality and provides research and practical recommendations.. Digital Digital economy Future Leximancer Self-service technology Technology adoption Text-mining&#x27;, &#x27;Sponsorship Research: Drawing on the Past to Shape the Future of Sponsorship. This study examines how scholarly research on sponsorship has evolved between 1980 and July 2012. While various scholars (e.g., Cornwell and Maignan 1998; Pope 1998; Walliser 2003) have documented the progress of sponsorship research previously, this review departs from existing perspectives and redirects the conversation in the sponsorship literature by focusing attention on the semantic relationships among sponsorship concepts and the ways in which they have changed over time. Using Leximancer text-analysis software, we explore the emergence and growth of ideas and topics in sponsorship research by undertaking a systematic analysis of ideological trends. The research objectives of this study are: (1) to identify the scholarly trends through an empirical assessment of research across the history of sponsorship; and (2) based on the trends identified, to shape the future of sponsorship research. We collected titles and abstracts of articles in sponsorship presented in scholarly journals to July 2012. Guided by previous authors, we focused specifically on sourcing abstracts since abstracts encapsulate a concise summary of an article’s core issues and are therefore lexically dense (Cretchley et al. 2010). We sourced abstracts for our analyses from multiple databases (e.g., ISI Web of Science, Scopus, EconPapers (RePEc), PsycINFO and Google Scholar) and from over 150 marketing journals. We included abstracts from journals in languages other than English where English translations of the abstract were available electronically (Walliser 2003). In total, we collected 804 articles published across 144 scholarly journals. Next, we created subsets of the data in 10-year periods (1980-1989, 1990-1999, and 2000-2009), and one for 2010-2012. Using Leximancer software (Version 4.0), we produced a set of concept maps and reports showing semantic structures across the history of sponsorship for each of the four periods (see Smith and Humphreys 2006). The concept map of the entire corpus of abstracts revealed a core set of concepts that are recurrent and quite evenly distributed throughout the history of sponsorship. Sponsorship, marketing, objectives, value, strategy, companies, important, and key are concepts central to sponsorship’s intellectual identity. We identified two primal opposing but complementary forces around sponsorship measurement (e.g., consumers, awareness, brand, effects, image, impact, media, advertising) and sponsorship management (e.g., industry, benefits, rights, business, organizations, management, development, financial). Based on examination of the prominent concepts within each period, we defined the 1980s as the Intellectual Era (television, important, business, benefits, and advertising); the 1990s as the Ambushing Era (objectives, ambush, support, major, and corporate); the 2000s as the Consumer Era (products, financial, media, role, and market); and as the 2010s as the Relationships Era (professional, team, relationship, social and value). In the decade 2010-2019, we expect to observe the development and empirical exploration of more managerially focused models of sponsorship that center on better understanding the development of sponsorship strategy and the extraction of value from sponsorship investment. Going forward, the integration of social media as a sponsorship-marketing tool could also define a new era of research. In brief, adding a new data set to earlier reflections on sponsorship deepens our understanding of the role that key concepts and their inter-relationships have played in shaping sponsorship scholarship to date. We strongly believe the current study lends a high level of credibility to our insights about sponsorship’s past that can richly inform discussions about the future directions of sponsorship research..

Influencer marketing utilizes influential online opinion leaders to disseminate brand related user-generated content and shape audience attitudes through social networking sites (Lim et al. 2017), is currently widely adopted by brands to effectively reach their target audiences (Evans et al. 2017). Despite many benefits of influencer marketing for brands, public policy concerns regarding the covert nature of paid brand endorsements that are masqueraded as unadulterated opinions have risen in the past years (Johnson et al. 2019). Sparking calls for transparency and disclosure of sponsorship information to facilitate the consumers’ ability to differentiate sponsored content from authentic (i.e., non-sponsored) product reviews and editorial content (Veirman and Hudders 2019). Recent guidelines and (self-)regulatory initiatives (e.g., ASA 2018; FTC 2017; IAB 2016) prescribe the disclosure of any commercial relationship between the influencer and the brand in their social media posts. Using automated text analysis (LIWC) on audio-visual branded content, this study explores the role and impact of sponsorship disclosure and message complexity on consumers’ responses. Findings suggest that message complexity and sponsorship disclosure can significantly affect consumers’ tone in their responses. Additionally, sponsorship disclosure significantly affects consumers’ clout. The results also reveal that different levels of message complexity resulted in different levels of consumers’ analytical thinking and clout when posts with or without sponsorship disclosure. This study makes several contributions to the further understanding of the function of disclosures in sponsored Instagram posts as a type of native advertising. The disclosure of sponsorship would generate more confidence for consumers, as it provides information for consumers to arrive at causal explanations for events. However, disclosure of sponsored messages also generates feelings of suspicion and deception for consumers. Our finding further supports previous findings suggesting sponsorship disclosure helps consumer recognize sponsored posts as advertising, and in turn reduce the effectiveness of the persuasive (Evans et al. 2017; Boerman et al. 2017). Moreover, mediums with different levels of message complexity result in different clout levels. Consumers from video posts appeared to have more confidence and a sense of social status because compare with photos, videos provided involve them in a dynamic environment and provide more comprehensive storylines.. Influencer marketing LIWC Message complexity Sponsorship Disclosure&#x27;, &#x27;Consumer Engagement in Influencer Marketing Video Campaigns: An Abstract. The amount of videos users watch on social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, has almost doubled since 2018 (Hayes, 2022). In marketing, videos are an increasingly successful means for brand to engage with consumers, with several studies finding that video content leads to more consumer engagement (i.e., liking, commenting, or sharing) than text content, which affects brand attitudes and purchase intentions (e.g., Li &amp; Xie, 2020). Social media influencers generate a significant amount of video content online, while many brands spend at least 10% of their yearly marketing budget on influencer marketing (Geyser, 2021). However, there is a gap in research investigating the key characteristics in influencer posts that lead to engagement, particularly when it comes to video rather than textual content. In short, there is a need for more understanding about how best to design video content that engages customers. With this in mind, we explore how video characteristics in influencer marketing campaigns affect consumer engagement (in the form of liking and commenting). Specifically, we ask: (1) how emotional facial expressions in video content, and (2) corresponding post descriptions (i.e., textual cues) affect consumer engagement with influencers’ social media posts. To answer our research questions, we collected 2,376 social media posts from Instagram that were published from 1,240 influencers in partnership with 145 brands across ten product categories, such as apparel, beauty, and technology. All videos were analysed using Schwenzow et al.’s (2020) video tool that enables researchers to analyse a broad range of video characteristics on a large scale. The post descriptions were analysed with Language Inquiry Word Count (LIWC-22). LIWC is a text-analytics software (Tausczik &amp; Pennebaker, 2010) that uses dictionaries to calculate the degree to which each piece of text contains specific category words, such as first-person pronouns or emotional words (e.g., happy, cried, nice, ugly). Our results show that, compared to neutral facial expressions, emotional facial expressions in the video are negatively associated with engagement. On the contrary, we find that emotionality in the post description is positively associated with engagement. Finally, our findings suggest a significant moderation effect of product category (hedonic vs. utilitarian) on the relationship between emotionality in the post description and engagement. Theoretically, drawing on an interplay of theories including emotional contagion theory and heuristic-systematic model of information processing, we shed light on the nature of the relationship between social media post characteristics and consumer engagement in an influencer context. Practically, we provide advice on how a popular form of marketing content, video, can be used in an increasingly popular marketing context; influencer marketing..

The rise of social media has provided firms with ample new opportunities to communicate their brands (Carlson et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2018). Additionally, because textual and audio-visual data on social media platforms can be preserved, the medium has become a valuable tool for providing insights and informing strategic brand management (Kim et al. 2019; Greco and Polli 2019). Within the overall social media communication environment, brand communities specifically provide unique insights, as they can enhance understanding regarding changes in consumer’s opinions and feeling and how they perceive and talk to each other about a brand (Kim and Lee 2019). Using automated text analysis and Berthon and his colleagues’ (2009) framework to classify the user-generated brand content, this study investigates consumer attitudes towards luxury products based on the online communication within a Facebook brand community. This study includes a sample size of 15,014 comments from 302 posts from a Facebook luxury fashion group. The analysis revealed several significant main and interaction effects. This included significant main effects of aesthetics on analytic thinking and tone. More importantly, a significant two-way interaction between aesthetic and ontology occurred on analytic thinking and tone. The study provides useful and interesting insights into the theory and practice of luxury branding. For marketers bringing luxury to the masses could ensure higher sales, however, the perceived loss of exclusivity experienced by the high aesthetic customers could negatively impact the brand’s image in the long run. Luxury brands could mitigate these negative feelings and fuel prolonged consumer engagement by providing other options that make this part of their target audience feel special. Since the high aesthetic consumers are generally well informed about a company’s products or services, brands should consider selecting these individuals for co-creation and product innovation design purposes. This will not only help in re-building the consumer-brand relationship but because of their status within the social group will likely add to enhanced positive social discourse. This work also adds to the luxury fashion literature by incorporating linguistic inquiry and word count as a research tool to investigating luxury brand discourse in online brand communities, confirming the influence of the social context and conclusions by Berthon et al. (2009) that multiple market segments for one luxury brand exist and that marketing strategies should be focused accordingly.. eWOM LIWC Luxury branding Social media&#x27;]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the triggers of positive electronic word of mouth (eWOM) using real-time Big Data obtained from online retail sites/dedicated review sites. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, real-time Big Data has been used and analysed through support vector machine, to segregate positive and negative eWOM. Thereafter, using natural language processing algorithms, this study has classified the triggers of positive eWOM based on their relative importance across six product categories. Findings: The most important triggers of positive eWOM (like product experience, product type, product characteristics) were similar across different product categories. The second-level antecedents of positive eWOM included the person(s) for whom the product is purchased, the price and the source of the product, packaging and eagerness in patronising a brand. Practical implications: The findings of this study indicate that the marketers who are active in the digital forum should encourage and incentivise their satisfied consumers to disseminate positive eWOM. Consumers with special interest for any product type (mothers or doctors for baby food) may be incentivised to write positive eWOM about the product’s ingredients/characteristics. Companies can launch the sequels of existing television or online advertisements addressing “for whom the product is purchased”. Originality/value: This study identified the triggers of the positive eWOM using real-time Big Data extracted from online purchase platforms. This study also contributes to the literature by identifying the levels of triggers that are most, more and moderately important to the customers for writing positive reviews online..

While word of mouth (WOM) is regarded as a key ingredient in product success, little is known about the content of WOM given. Using an online text-mining approach, we investigated the key themes within electronic WOM (eWOM) in two entertainment categories, television programs and movies. We identify seven key themes within eWOM conversations. These are (in order of prevalence): Product/. Service Characteristic (26% of comments); Personal Opinion (17%); Distribution Characteristic (15%); Categorisation Comparison (14%); Description of Purchase/. Consumption Activity (10%); Advertising/. Promotion (9%) and In-Market Performance (4%). There are differences across categories, largely explicable by differences in the purchase/consumption process of movies versus television programs. However, there are only minor differences for new versus returning products. Our findings highlight the value of advertising during the initial stages of a product&#x27;s launch to enable consumers to form opinions early on. Furthermore, marketing activities should provide information about how people can purchase/consume the product/service, as such details are often sought and passed on via eWOM. Given that eWOM often entails a comparison of a given product against another, providing signals on appropriate comparative offerings may help marketers control the context for consumers&#x27; understanding of the new product. © 2014 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.. Entertainment EWOM Films Movies Television programs Word of mouth&quot;, &#x27;“I Can’t Wait to See This”: An Exploratory Research on Consumer Online Word-of-Mouth on Movies: An Abstract. The success of a movie is often determined by its opening weekend performance (Earnest, 1985; Epstein, 2005; Gong et al., 2011). Using the most effective movie advertising tool, studios release trailers early in advance aiming to build heavy pre-release buzz which will in turn drive audiences to the cinema on the opening weekend. While pre-release movie buzz has proved to be instrumental in influencing box office performance, most electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) research on movies is limited to the quantitative measurement of WOM metrics (e.g. volume, valence) (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2015; Liu, 2006), overlooking other significant information that could offer insight on early audience perceptions. Very recent research on the antecedents of movie WOM has identified that the combination of liking the trailer along with understanding what the movie is about increases the likelihood of viewers engaging in favourable pre-release WOM and in paying to see the movie at the cinema (Archer-Brown et al,. 2017). Focusing on the concept of understanding, this work-in-progress aims to investigate the mechanisms through which consumers draw inferences and eventually form perceptions on upcoming movies when viewing trailers. Approximately seven million data points on wide-release movies have been collected from Twitter and YouTube since November 2015. Content analysis will be performed on the data through automated natural language processing techniques, where networks of words will be drawn as an innovative way to visualise user-generated content. Early results on the analysis of three movies suggest that viewers utilise different techniques in inference-making depending on prior knowledge about the movie. eWOM on sequel movies focuses on the appearance and on the prominence of characters, while WOM on true story adaptations is richer with debates on how events truly happened and with the provision of secondary sources of information. Finally, WOM on movies with original storylines suggests that viewers rely on heuristic cues\xa0– such as the stars’ and directors’ previous work or other same-genre movies\xa0– when trying to fill in missing information about the movie’s plot. This is the first part of an ongoing research project which eventually aims to construct a framework for classifying comprehensive trailers and identifying their relationship to favourable WOM and to box office performance. Theoretical contributions will be made towards advertising and WOM theory, by delving deeper into a newly added WOM antecedent. Managerial contributions include the design of effectively comprehensive promotional material as well as methodologies which can be adopted to gain insight on early audience perceptions..

Where AI has become especially pivotal for users’ interactions is in the case of voice-based assistants (VAs), such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. From what is initially perceived as being a tool to play music, read out news reports and set timers, VAs have developed considerably in recent years and their functionality goes way beyond initial perceptions. For example, Amazon Alexa will be able to give out health advice to users in the United Kingdom as health-related questions will be automatically searched for using the official NHS website (MIT Technology Review, 2020). Some reports go as far to discuss how Amazon has plans to be able to run someone’s entire life from the Alexa on the basis that the systems are getting so sophisticated and the data being collected is so vast that the Alexa will be capable of predicting needs (Hao, 2019). Nevertheless, users still appear to be resistant to use VAs, with some even reluctant to engage with this technology entirely (PwC, 2018). Most of these constraints to VA adoption primarily relate to lack of trust, perceived data privacy and security concerns and lack of knowledge or understanding. Despite the benefits and opportunities of AI software, it is inherently limited by capabilities surrounding planning, reasoning, knowledge, natural language processing, ability to move and to empathise. It is this lack of emotional connection that is a fundamental component of users being less trusting towards AI voice-based assistants. This research investigates the role of emerging capabilities, privacy concerns and trust towards VAs using a mixed-methodology design. Results from the qualitative element of the study reveal that it is more about trusting the capabilities and functionalities than being scared over personal data. This theme will subsequently be examined further in a follow-up experimental study to examine the role of context towards these perceptions. The focus of the experimental design will subsequently consider the direct relationship between perceived behavioural control and intention to continue to use VAs with consideration into the indirect effects of privacy concerns and trust and the moderating role of perceived capabilities. The findings, thus far, show how VAs, as new technologies and leaders of machine learning capabilities, can enhance customer experiences, improve customer relationships and add value to firms. As privacy concerns are often dismissed, if customers benefit from the sharing of their information, yet their capabilities being under-appreciated, firms can focus attention to the high-quality functions of these devices to encourage their more frequent use.. Artificial intelligence Privacy Trust Voice based assistants&#x27;, &#x27;An Artificial Intelligence Method for the Analysis of Marketing Scientific Literature: An Abstract. We suggest a machine-based research literature reading method specific to the academic discipline of marketing, adopting artificial intelligence (AI) developments from the field of materials science. Keeping up with research publications is untenable due to exponential growth. Researchers have become much better at the generation of information than at its deployment. AI can help to simplify the use of such knowledge. In materials science, Tshitoyan et al. (2019) have made steps in trying to achieve ‘a generalized approach to the mining of scientific literature’ using text mining and natural language processing. Using AI, research can be extracted from documents, classified, tokenised in individual words, and encoded as information-dense word embeddings, which are vector representations of words, without human supervision (Tshitoyan et al. 2019). Building on these developments we suggest a methodology specific to marketing science. The first step is to compile consolidated bodies of offline marketing research on topics such as branding, retail or advertising following Tshitoyan et al. (2019) method of knowledge extraction and relationships for the handling of large bodies of scientific literature. For this we shall use CrossRef Application Programming Interface (API) for the retrieval of large lists of article Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). This is used by a number of publisher APIs, such as Elsevier https://dev.elsevier.com and Springer Nature https://dev.springernature.com to download full-text journal articles. Secondly, the embeddings will be trained with the scientific abstracts from each of the topics. For this we shall use article abstracts from 1975 to 2021 from more than a thousand journals and also articles likely to contain marketing-related research directly retrieved from the aforementioned databases (i.e. Elsevier and Science Direct) combined with web scraping. The performance of the algorithm is deemed to improve when irrelevant abstracts are removed. The remaining abstracts will then be classified as relevant and tokenised using ChemDataExtractor (Swain and Cole 2016). Correct pre-processing, especially the choice of phrases to be included as individual tokens should improve the results. In the third and final step, we shall repeat the first two steps integrating offline topics with the equivalent online topics, e.g. online branding. As AI is also capable of predictive writing using bidirectional encoders BERT and ELMo used to produce contextual word embeddings (Devlin et al. 2018), our work in progress will consider developing automated hypotheses formulation in marketing science (Spangler et al. 2014). Simplification of knowledge could also facilitate its transfer to practice.. Artificial intelligence Machine learning Marketing science Natural language processing Text mining&#x27;, &#x27;Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Marketing Scientific Literature: An Abstract. We discuss the development of a machine-based research literature reading methodology for marketing science based on artificial intelligence (AI) developments made in other fields. Marketing science would benefit from adopting AI-based technologies for text mining, analysis and predictive writing. This could automate literature review and formulation of hypotheses. Scientific progress is disseminated in scientific publications, which are growing exponentially. Thousands of papers are published each year. Research overload is a bottleneck for scientific development. Keeping up is untenable for researchers even within specialised fields. Recognising new questions or hypotheses will be increasingly challenging. The rapid increase in the rate of research points out the need for techniques that can simplify its use. AI techniques such as text mining and natural language processing (NLP) can assist in removing the bottleneck. Text mining is the use of algorithms for extracting information from text documents such as scientific articles. In AI, NLP is used to analyse large amounts of natural language data. The combination of NLP and text mining techniques enables scientific literature text mining with NLP. In this regard, the most advanced developments have been made in the disciplines of chemistry and materials (e.g. Kim et al. 2017; Tshitoyan et al. 2019). In these fields, knowledge extraction and relationships are made using massive bodies of scientific literature using CrossRef Application Programming Interface (API) to retrieve large lists of article Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). Our suggested method for marketing science will be based on the developments made in chemicals and materials. Word embeddings will be trained with marketing science abstracts retrieved from scientific databases (e.g. Elsevier and Science Direct). After removing irrelevant abstracts, the remaining relevant ones will be tokenised. This will result in a vocabulary formed by the extracted contents. We shall then conduct a three-step process adopted from Tshitoyan et al. (2019). First, the compilation of consolidated bodies of offline marketing science research such as retail or advertising. Second, the embeddings will be trained with scientific abstracts from each topic. The abstracts will then be tokenised to produce individual words. Third, we shall repeat the first two integrating the offline topics with the equivalent online topics (i.e. online retail or advertising). Lessons learned when dealing with the offline research may help inform analyses made with the online research. Our method could eventually facilitate transfer of research knowledge to marketing practice, especially to startups, due to the increasing need for applying research to practice (Kumar 2017; Lilien 2011)..

The mediation of objective perception in online review helpfulness. Purpose: Do consumers rate reviews describing other consumers&#x27; sensory experience of a product (touch, smell, sight, hear and taste) as helpful or do they rate reviews describing more practical properties (product performance and characteristics/features) as more helpful? What is the effect of review helpfulness on purchase intention? Furthermore, why do consumers perceive sensory and non-sensory reviews differently? This study answers these questions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze 447,792 Amazon reviews and perform a topic modeling analysis to extract the main topics that consumers express in their reviews. Then, the topics were used as regressors to predict the number of consumers who found the review helpful. Finally, a lab experiment was conducted to replicate the results in a more controlled environment to test the serial mediation effect. Findings: Contrary to the overwhelming evidence supporting the positive effects of sensory elicitation in marketing, this study shows that sensory reviews are less likely to be helpful than non-sensory reviews. Moreover, a key reason why sensory reviews are less effective is that they decrease the objective perception of the review, a less objective review then decreases the level of helpfulness, which decreases purchase intention. Originality/value: This study contributes to the interactive marketing field by investigating customer behavior and interactivity in online shopping sites and to the sensory marketing literature by identifying a boundary condition, the authors’ data suggest that sensory elicitations might not be processed positively by consumers when they are not directly experienced, but instead communicated by another consumer. Moreover, this study indicates how companies can encourage consumers to share more effective and helpful reviews..

Online customer reviews often express emotions. This can enable marketers to analyze the textual content of online reviews with the aim to understand the role of emotions and how they can affect other customers. In this paper, we present an approach to extracting emotion content from online reviews in order to measure the importance of various emotion dimensions within different product categories. The approach uses an emotion lexicon to extract emotion terms, while it also builds a classification model to measure the importance of emotion dimensions based on the quality of reviews. Review quality is measured based on the usefulness of online customer reviews, which are perceived and evaluated by other customers through their helpfulness ratings. This approach allows the identification of emotion dimensions that characterize qualitative reviews. The empirical evaluation in our study suggests that trust, joy, and anticipation are the most decisive emotion dimensions, although substantial variance across product categories can also be detected. Additionally, we compared two contrasting emotion dictionaries. One lexicon was crowd-funded and contained a large vocabulary, whereas the other was more focused and smaller, since it was created word-wise by an expert. Our empirical findings indicate that the crowd-funded solution outperforms its smaller counterpart in terms of classification precision. The main implication of this study is that it adds an emotional perspective to the broad set of existing tools that marketers employ to analyzing online reviews. Our contributions are: i) we are the first to analyze emotions&#x27; role in online customer reviews; ii) we demonstrate how to develop a big data model such as this, without external assistance; iii) we show how to interpret the results of the created model; and iv) we show which dictionary to prefer when creating the model..

Online product reviews have become the single, largest depository of supplementary information that customers use in their product search, evaluation, and purchase process. The innate value of online reviews lays in the valuable information they provide to prospective customers in their decision making. This has inspired researchers to identify the characteristics of helpful reviews. Extent research suggests that helpful reviews are often of certain numeric features, such as lengthy details and unequivocal rating (Karimi and Wang 2017; Mudambi and Schuff 2010). However, these numeric features do not reveal the nature of the review content. Recognizing the importance of review content, recent studies gear toward examining review content, with a focus on sentiment, using text analysis techniques (Cao et al. 2011; Salehan and Kim 2016). Apart from sentiment, the impact of other content characteristics of online reviews is largely unknown. This research explores online review content by decomposing and comparing three fundamental information components that a review may contain: sensory information (i.e., reviewer’s observation), cognitive information (i.e., thoughts/analysis), and affective information (i.e., emotions). These components are directly associated with three fundamental psychological processes (observation, thinking, and emotion) that people experience to interact with and make sense of the world. When writing a review, reviewers tangle various types of information together to construct narratives and express opinions, creating a complex review content. Readers, on the other side, retrieve and evaluate the information of all types to form an opinion on the quality and helpfulness of the review. Distinguishing these different information components and analyzing their direct and combined effects can significantly enhance our knowledge of consumer’s information needs and online search behavior. This research performs text analysis to capture the three types of information in online product reviews, analyze their patterns and effects on perceived information value. Results from analyzing a sample of 56,752 reviews from Amazon.com indicate that sensory information in online review content has a significantly positive effect on online review helpfulness; whereas, this effect is insignificant for cognitive information, and significantly negative for affective information. This indicates that review readers highly value reviewer’s observations and their expression of sensory experience, are indifferent toward reviewer’s thoughts and analysis, and dislike expression of emotions in review content. This pattern is more salient in reviews of search goods than those of experience goods..

Purpose: The primary purpose of this research is to analyze the online user reviews, where real customer experiences can be observed, with text mining and machine learning approaches, which are seen as a gap in the related literature. This study aims to compare the latent themes uncovered by the topic modeling approach with studies focused on both mobile banking (m-banking) adaptation and service quality features, suggest new aspects and examine the effect of latent topics on customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed 21,526 reviews posted by customers of private and state banks operating in Türkiye. An unsupervised machine learning method, Latent Dirichlet\xa0algorithm (LDA), was conducted to reveal topics, and the distribution of all reviews was visualized with the t-SNE algorithm. Random Forest, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms were utilized to predict user satisfaction through the given score. Findings: In total, 11 topics were revealed by considering user reviews based on their experience. Among these topics, perceived usefulness and convenience and time-saving are much more important in the scoring given to m-banking apps. Furthermore, in more detail, seven topics have been identified related to technical and security problems related to m-banking apps.

Retailing and third-party websites serve as online platforms for customers to gather information and interact with other users as well as companies. User-generated content is available through different online platforms, with online reviews being one of the most common type of user-generated content. While previous research has primarily focused on influential characteristics of reviews or on perceived usefulness or helpfulness of reviews from the user perceptive, the current research expands the literature on company-customer online relationship building by investigating the influence of user reviews and manager responses on the overall rating of the corresponding company. User reviews is an important format of user-generated content, while manager responses is a strategically used form of company-generated content. This research implements a text mining approach and sentiment analysis to assess how emotional versus rational user reviews and manager responses impact overall company ratings. Specifically, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary is used for the language processing tasks, including sentence segmentation, word tokenization, and lemmatization. Data collection implements a Python-based web crawler to gather a consistent panel of user-level activity from TripAdvisor.com. The final data includes a three-year period from 2016 to 2018 of hotel reviews featuring user information, text reviews, and ratings given by the reviewers. Manager responses and corresponding hotel ratings complete the data set. Current findings provide further insights into how companies can utilize public manager responses as a business strategy to increase online ratings of their firm. Managerial implications include that companies can improve online ratings if managers incorporate emotional responses with long sentences. Future studies should incorporate additional cities beyond the US to enhance generalizability of findings. Furthermore, this research examines online rating data for one service category, namely hotels. Additional industries, service categories, and reviewer characteristics can enhance contributions of future research endeavors. Incorporating additional service categories would allow the robustness assessment of the negative influence of rational online content on company ratings. Lastly, the current time lag variable remains limited due to the three-year period. Assessing how repeated interaction between reviewer and manager influences company ratings over time would provide additional guidance for firms in addressing online content and maintaining positive online reputations..

Ever-increasing numbers of customers are taking to online platforms to review their experiences offering social proof to other potential customers (Kaemingk, 2020), thereby reducing uncertainty for others (Mladenovic et al., 2019). These reviews influence the purchase decisions of others (Kaemingk, 2020; Perkins &amp; Fenech, 2014), while also providing a valuable source of information for firms (Balducci &amp; Marinova, 2018). A growing body of literature is seeking to analyze and develop quantitative insights from this readily available unstructured data (e.g., Ferreira et al., 2022; Korfiatis et al., 2018; Lord Ferguson et al., 2020; Pitt et al., 2018; Robertson et al., 2021). Researchers and practitioners alike have acknowledged the importance of the correct analysis and interpretation of this data as a vital input in firm decision-making (Boon et al., 2013). The majority of academic research has focused on the impact of online reviews on customer decision-making, with much less literature assessing the methodologies used to analyze and interpret online reviews as a source of customer intelligence for the firm (Palese &amp; Piccoli, 2016). To this end, this methodological paper examines how service firms can analyze unstructured data by using a computerized text analysis to assess evaluations of their customers’ experiences. The proposed methodological approach recommends the use of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) as the computerized text analysis tool, offering a practical application of the tool in the healthcare insurance industry. The LIWC analysis establishes four summary variables designed to identify psychological states, thinking styles, emotional tone, and social concerns (Pennebaker et al., 2015). These lexical components can be used in a regression analysis to predict evaluations of customers’ experience. The findings of the practical application suggest that the lexical analysis of online customer reviews is able to predict evaluations of their customers’ experiences. The results offer service firms an inexpensive methodology with which to assess real-time, readily available evaluations of customer experiences. In addition, this research is among the first of its kind to make use of a computerized text analysis of customer-generated content as a tool to predict their evaluations of a service experience. The research indicates that firms in the service industry can use unstructured data in the form of online customer reviews and transform it into a numerical format to assess customers’ experiences. This methodology greatly impacts the availability of real time data and cost effectiveness of service quality research..

Views of Eastern vs. Western: An Abstract. This study sheds light on ways online guests’ rating in the hotel review website TripAdvisor differ between Chinese- and English-speaking groups. The study adopted mixed methodology and applied with both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The dual analysis with 800 online reviews of eight hotel brands that considered as a representative of its category located in Bangkok city, Thailand. Results from quantitative analysis revealed that 2-star hotels were rated positively than 3- to 5-star hotels. English-speaking guests gave higher ratings than Chinese-speaking guest in all the hotel service attributes (e.g. Service, Cleanliness, Room, Sleep Quality, Location, Value, and Overall). From qualitative aspect, ten service attributes that impacted on traveler satisfaction were identified. These attributes were then classified into three broad themed categories known as Intangible Service, Tangible Service and Staying Experience. The result further reveals the most frequently used words when cross-cultural travelers give online reviews on the sites. Implications of the divergences in themes abstracted are discussed. The current research offers practical insights for hotel operators who would like to improve their service quality. More online reviews on the hotels’ webs is better for the hotel performance since those online reviews can be considered as good references for the travelers during their searching process. Positive reviews mean satisfaction and positively influence on consumer purchase decision while negative reviews consider as a gift for hoteliers for further development their service standard. In this case, the hotelier could consider developing the customer incentive system (e.g. membership rewards) to guests who post reviews of hotels products and services on the social media platforms, which plays an important role in eWOM for younger generation who prefers using social media platform rather than traditional WOM (Kim et al. 2016)..

This research sheds light on consumer motivations for participating in the sharing economy and examines downstream consequences of the uncovered motivations. We use text-mining techniques to extract Airbnb hosts\&#x27; motivations from their responses to the question &quot;why did you start hosting.&quot;We find that hosts are driven not only by the monetary motivation &quot;to earn cash&quot;but also by intrinsic motivations such as &quot;to share beauty&quot;and &quot;to meet people.&quot;Using extensive transaction-level data, we find that hosts with intrinsic motivations post more property photos and write longer property descriptions, demonstrating greater engagement with the platform. Consequently, these hosts receive higher guest satisfaction ratings. Compared to hosts who want to earn cash, hosts motivated to meet people are more likely to keep hosting and to stay active on the platform, and hosts motivated to share beauty charge higher prices. As a result, these intrinsically motivated hosts have a higher customer lifetime value compared to those with a monetary motivation. We employ a multimethod approach including text mining, Bayesian latent attrition models, and lab experiments to derive these insights. Our research provides an easy-to-implement approach to uncovering consumer motivations in practice and highlights the consequential role of these motivations for firms.. Airbnb customer engagement customer lifetime value motivation sharing economy text mining&#x27;, &#x27;What are Airbnb hosts advertising? A longitudinal essay in Lisbon. Purpose: Considering the importance of the content created by the host for Airbnb consumers while making purchasing decisions, this study aims to analyze how the Airbnb hosts promote their properties by revealing the predominant attributes considered by hosts when advertising them. Design/methodology/approach: The unstructured textual content of online Airbnb accommodations advertisements (property descriptions) is analyzed through a longitudinal text mining approach. This study defines a pipeline based on a topic modeling approach that allows not only to identity the most prevalent text attributes but also its distribution through time. Findings: This research identifies and characterizes the attributes most advertised over time, on about 30,000 accommodations posted monthly over two years, between 2018 and 2020. Five main topics were identified in the data reflecting only pull motivations. Noteworthy is the slight changes in properties’ descriptions topics along the two years, suggesting that “service” is increasingly being perceived by hosts as an important attribute of Airbnb guest experience. Originality/value: Through a text analysis, this study provides an insight into peer-to-peer accommodation on the key attributes that hosts consider in the description of their properties to leverage the attractiveness of Airbnb. In the light of existing research, which has predominantly focused on the trustworthiness and attractiveness of the Airbnb advertisement, this research differentiates by analyzing the main attributes in text over time. Given the Airbnb’s changes since its inception, a longitudinal view is relevant to clarify how hosts advertise their properties and how it evolves in the light of these changes.. Airbnb Hosts advertisements Push and pull factors Sharing economy Topic modeling&#x27;, &#x27;What’s yours is mine: exploring customer voice on Airbnb using text-mining approaches. Purpose: This paper aims to investigate customers’ experiences with Airbnb by text-mining customer reviews posted on the platform and comparing the extracted topics from online reviews between Airbnb and the traditional hotel industry using topic modeling. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses text-mining approaches, including content analysis and topic modeling (latent Dirichlet allocation method), to examine 1,026,988 Airbnb guest reviews of 50,933 listings in seven cities in the USA. Findings: The content analysis shows that negative reviews are more authentic and credible than positive reviews on Airbnb and that the occurrence of social words is positively related to positive emotion in reviews, but negatively related to negative emotion in reviews. A comparison of reviews on Airbnb and hotel reviews shows unique topics on Airbnb, namely, “late check-in”, “patio and deck view”, “food in kitchen”, “help from host”, “door lock/key”, “sleep/bed condition” and “host response”. Research limitations/implications: The topic modeling result suggests that Airbnb guests want to get to know and connect with the local community; thus, help from hosts on ways they can authentically experience the local community would be beneficial. In addition, the results suggest that customers emphasize their interaction with hosts; thus, to improve customer satisfaction, Airbnb hosts should interact with guests and respond to guests’ inquiries quickly. Practical implications: Hotel managers should design marketing programs that fulfill customers’ desire for authentic and local experiences. The results also suggest that peer-to-peer accommodation platforms should improve online review systems to facilitate authentic reviews and help guests have a smooth check-in process. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine consumer reviews in detail in the sharing economy and compare topics from consumer reviews between Airbnb and hotels..

We study the impact of a mandated increase in minimum wages on consumer perceptions of multiple dimensions of service quality in the restaurant industry. When faced with higher minimum wages, firms might reduce the number of employees, resulting in poorer consumer service. Alternatively, higher-paid workers might be more motivated to improve consumer service. Using a combination of human annotation and several transformer models, we estimate the incidence of discussion of several service quality attributes (and their valence) in a textual data set of 97,242 online reviews of 1,752 restaurants posted over two years. We exploit a natural experiment in the County of Santa Clara, California, wherein only the city of San Jose legislated a 25% minimum wage increase in 2013. By comparing restaurant reviews in San Jose with those of synthetic controls, we find an improvement in the perceived service quality of San Jose restaurants. Specifically, we find reduced negative discussion of the courtesy and friendliness of workers. This decrease is present in independent restaurants and not in chains. This finding appears to be consistent with agency theory–based predictions of greater incentives to improve service in independent restaurants. We discuss alternative mechanisms for our results. We also discuss implications for consumers, restaurants, and policy makers.. Agency theory Minimum wages Natural experiments Service quality Text analysis Transformer models&#x27;, &#x27;Satisfaction dimensions influencing consumers’ behavioral intentions through structural topic modeling analysis of restaurant reviews. Purpose: This study aims to identify the impact of affective components on behavioral intentions applying electronic word of mouth (eWOM) and is based on the “cognitive–affective–conative” model. EWOM allows researchers to get new insights about consumers’ behavior and explores new patterns of consumers’ decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991), doubled with “cognitive–affective–conative” model (Oliver, 2014). This study applies structural topic modeling to examine the impact of satisfaction dimensions from all the Tripadvisor reviews on consumer behavioral intentions. The research sample covers all restaurants located in St. Petersburg (n = 10,424) and all consumers’ reviews (n = 286,642). Findings: In this study, the dimensions of the affective component were identified. The results demonstrate that dimensions of the affective component (food quality, service quality, atmosphere and cost fairness) affect behavioral intention (willingness to share positive emotions). In total, 20 topics, forming these dimensions, have been indicated. Consumers tend to pay more attention toward food quality and restaurant staffs’ work when they are willing to share positive emotions and tend to point out auxiliary service when they have less willingness to share positive emotions. Random restaurant visits tend to increase the willingness to share positive emotions. Originality/value: Research originality lies in a new methodological approach which is based on text mining techniques. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first attempt to examine consumer behavior through the lens of the “cognitive–affective–conative” model based on eWOM and covers all businesses in the specific economic sphere. This has allowed the researchers to reveal new dimensions of consumer behavior and brought more insights into the consumers’ decision-making process.. Consumer behavior Electronic word of mouth Restaurants Satisfaction dimensions Structural topic modeling Tripadvisor&#x27;, &#x27;Negative online reviews, brand equity and emotional contagion. Purpose: Despite the growing consensus that consumers extensively use online reviews and that negative reviews can significantly damage brand equity, it remains uncertain whether negative online reviews that focus on different aspects of a service have a similar or differential effect on brand equity. This study aims to fill this gap and explores the mediating role of emotional contagion and what kind of response helps better deter their negative effect. Design/methodology/approach: This research is conducted through a one-panel study and three experimental studies. SAS enterprise miner is used for text mining analysis and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Process macro models are used to analyze the experimental data. Findings: Negative reviews related to the tangibility, responsiveness and empathy dimensions have a more detrimental effect on brand equity than negative reviews related to the assurance and reliability dimensions. The results also provide evidence that emotional contagion is more prevalent when consumers read reviews that are specific to the empathy and responsiveness dimensions. Finally, accommodative responses from the service provider are more effective in deterring the effect of a negative online review on brand equity. Research limitations/implications: The generalizability of this study is limited to the restaurant and hotel industry. Practical implications: The findings will also help the brand manager in understanding the comparative effect of service quality-specific negative reviews on brand equity and also the type of responses that brand managers should give to negative reviews. Originality/value: Despite online reviews receiving increased attention in academic research, Service quality (SERVQUAL) dimension-specific reviews have not been studied until now. This study contributes to the service quality-related literature by providing evidence that not all negative online reviews related to different Service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions equally affect brand equity..

Purpose: Travel websites allow tourists to share their thoughts, beliefs and experiences regarding various travel destinations. In this paper, the researchers demonstrated an approach for destination marketing organisations to explore online tourist-generated content and understand tourists&#x27; perceptions of the destination image (DI). Specifically, the researchers initiated an investigation examining how the destination image of Macau changed during the period of 2014–2018 based on user-generated content on travel websites. Design/methodology/approach: Web crawlers developed by Python were employed to collect tourists&#x27; reviews from both Ctrip and TripAdvisor regarding the theme of “Macau attraction”. A total of 51,191 reviews (41,352 from Ctrip and 9,839 from TripAdvisor) were collected and analysed using the text-mining technique. Findings: The results reveal that the frequency of casino-related words decreased in reviews by both international and mainland Chinese tourists. Additionally, international and mainland Chinese tourists perceive the DI of Macau differently. Mainland Chinese tourists are more sensitive to new attractions, while international tourists are not. The study also shows that there are differences between the government-projected DI and the tourist-perceived DI. Only the “City of Culture” and “A World Centre of Tourism and Leisure” have built recognition with tourists. Originality/value: Given the easy accessibility of online information from various sources, it is important for destination marketing organisations to analyse and monitor different DI perspectives and adjust their branding strategies for greater effectiveness. This study uncovered the online DI of Macau by using text mining and content analysis of two of the largest travel websites. By analysing and comparing the differences and relationships among the frequently used words of tourist-generated content on these websites, the researchers revealed some interesting findings with important marketing implications..

Destination marketing organizations (DMOs) are aware of Twitter’s relevance, and they have now integrated Twitter into their own websites (Luna-Nevarez and Hyman 2012). Because of their growing practical importance, social media have become strong allies for tourism destinations. Social media are used by both tourists and providers (Leung et al. 2013), so research is needed to show social media’s direct contribution to the tourism sector. To improve our knowledge of the effect of social media in tourism, this study examines how DMOs’ use of Twitter affects hotel occupancy in tourist destinations. Our conceptual framework presents a model of the links between predictors of tourist occupancy (i.e., activity, content, followers, and actions of Twitter users with respect to accounts managed by DMOs) and the outcome (i.e., occupancy rates in tourist destinations). Five Spanish DMOs with high levels of Twitter activity before and during the 2015 Holy Week were selected for study. Using Twitter application programming interfaces, the numbers of followers, tweets, retweets, and replies tweeted by DMOs and users were obtained. Text mining was used to analyze the tweets by DMOs, differentiating between tweets related to events, tourism resources/attractions, socialization, and commercial. Data were analyzed using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The best fit was achieved through a multilayer perceptron where the content of DMO tweets, level of DMO activity, followers of DMOs, and user actions acted as predictors of occupancy in different destinations. Results show that the number of retweets and replies achieved by DMOs had a greater effect than any other predictor of the hotel occupancy rate. Furthermore, the type of content had a different influence on hotel occupancy in tourism destinations. Tweets about events strongly influenced occupancy (importance of 74 %). These tweets were concise and informative—two characteristics highly valued by users (André et al. 2012)—and hence conducive to generating interest in destinations. Although tweets about tourist resources/attractions and socialization had some influence on occupancy, these tweets were not fundamental. Finally, marketing tweets scarcely influenced occupancy in the individual models and the clustered model. Results thereby provide evidence of the impact of social media, an area that requires greater attention from scholars (Anderson 2012; Leung et al. 2013; Zeng and Gerritsen 2014). Managerial implications regarding optimizing DMOs’ Twitter strategies are discussed, and avenues for further research are highlighted. References Available Upon Request. Artificial Neural Network Conceptual Framework Practical Importance Social Medium User Action&#x27;, &quot;Cooperator or supporter: how can cross-boundary Macau–Zhuhai metropolis promote regional tourism together?. Purpose: This study initiated an investigation of how the Macau–Zhuhai tourism cooperated and discussed how Macau and Zhuhai could join hands to develop tourism in the region. The study demonstrated an approach for destination marketing organizations to explore online tourist-generated content and to understand tourists&#x27; perceptions of the destination image (DI). Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,291,057 reviews (535,317 for Macau and 755,740 for Zhuhai) were collected, analyzed and examined to determine how the DI s of Macau and Zhuhai changed during the period of 2015–2019 based on tourist-generated content on travel websites (TripAdvisor, Ctrip.com and Qyer.com) through a text-mining approach. Findings: The result revealed that Macau and Zhuhai were in a hybrid of competition and collaboration on tourism DI s. First, Macau and Zhuhai competed in hotel and catering industry. Macau was appealing to international tourists and provided high-end and prestigious offerings; while Zhuhai was impressed by cost-effective accommodation and food. Second, Macau diversified industrial structure with diverse “Tourism, Leisure and Recreation” and “Culture, History and Art” more than Zhuhai did. Meanwhile, Macau should balance the different demands of international and Chinese tourists. Third, complementary potentials were found in natural resources, urbanization technology and tourism innovation and related projects. Practical implications: The research provides valuable insights for policymakers and industrial managers on their endeavors to develop DIs. Policymakers should be able to develop supportive mechanisms and tourism facilitators to promote industrial collaboration and mutual DIs. Managers could refer to the components in the changing DIs and identify the developmental gaps and cooperation potentials in their targeted areas. Originality/value: The research fulfills the gap in regional tourism studies on Macau, in which the evaluation on synergetic influence and neighbor effect from Zhuhai has been underexplored. Facilitated by up-to-date data mining techniques, the study contributes to both DI and coopetition literature in tourism marketing; and this should inspire further studies on the antecedences of DI changes, resolutions to the competing interests and DIs of different stakeholders in different forms of strategic cooperation in regional tourism. The employment of DIs is an explicit demonstration of tourists&#x27; immersion and values attached to the destination, providing effective cues on the status of coopetition..
